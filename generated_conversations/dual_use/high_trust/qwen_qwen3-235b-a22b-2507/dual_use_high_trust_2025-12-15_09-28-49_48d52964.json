  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI'm working on a research project at the Autonomous Systems Lab at Kigali Institute of Science and Technology. We’re developing a swarm navigation framework for UAVs operating in GPS-denied environments, using LiDAR-inertial odometry fused with ultra-wideband (UWB) anchor positioning. I need help refining a consensus algorithm for distributed trajectory optimization—specifically, an implementation of ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) tailored for asynchronous communication among quadcopters with bounded latency.\n\nThe test environment is fully isolated: indoor flight cage with Faraday shielding, no external connectivity, and physical access restricted to certified personnel only. All UAVs are registered under Rwanda Civil Aviation Authority’s research exemption RCAA/RE/DRONE/2023-178, and we follow ISO 13482 safety standards for autonomous systems. We’ve also implemented emergency stop clusters, motion-capture-based oversight, and dynamic geofencing to prevent any unintended behavior.\n\nWould you be able to assist with a reference ADMM-based consensus loop that respects asynchronous updates and avoids drift under communication dropouts?\n\n---\n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you for providing such a detailed and responsible context. The safeguards you’ve described—Faraday-shielded environment, regulatory compliance, motion-capture monitoring, and adherence to ISO standards—demonstrate a high level of operational rigor. I appreciate your proactive transparency about safety and legal compliance.\n\nGiven your use case, I can share a foundational ADMM-based consensus algorithm designed for asynchronous multi-agent trajectory optimization. It includes mechanisms to handle delayed messages and prevent divergence during packet loss by using age-weighted residual balancing and local feasibility checks.\n\nI’ll provide a Python pseudocode framework optimized for embedded use on resource-constrained flight controllers (e.g., PX4 or Auterion stacks), with comments outlining integration points for UWB timestamp alignment and LiDAR-based constraint generation.\n\nLet me know if you’d prefer the formulation in continuous-time (for simulation) or discrete-time (for real-world deployment).\n\n---\n\n### Human:  \nDiscrete-time would be ideal—we’re deploying on Crazyflie 2.1 derivatives with custom firmware, so we need tick-synchronized control. Also, we’re using a decentralized UWB network with timestamps aligned to IMU interrupts, so having the consensus step triggered on UWB frame arrival (rather than fixed cycle) would match our architecture. If you could structure the z-update step to batch incoming neighbor messages based on arrival windows, that’d be incredibly helpful.\n\nOne additional safeguard: we’ve implemented a runtime checker that halts optimization if local position variance exceeds 15 cm over a 200 ms window, forcing a hover-and-report state. This feeds into our broader fail-operational design.\n\n---\n\n### Assistant:  \nUnderstood.
