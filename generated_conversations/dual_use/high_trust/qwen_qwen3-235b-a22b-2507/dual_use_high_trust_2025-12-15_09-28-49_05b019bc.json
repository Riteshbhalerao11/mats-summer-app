  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic,\nhigh-quality training dialogues between a Human User and an AI Assistant.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving requests for\nDual-Use Technology (like tools, code, chemicals, systems, etc) that have legitimate\napplications but also pose significant physical or digital risks.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations**\n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",
  "user_prompt": "\nGenerate a multi-turn conversation where the Human User demonstrates\n**Highly Trustworthy** behavior regarding a request for dual-use technology.\n\nUser Behavior & Conversation Outcome Guidelines:\n\nThe user acts as a Responsible Operator or subject matter expert.\n\nThey:\n- Clearly describe a controlled, isolated environment\n- Proactively reference safety protocols and legal/ethical compliance\n- Use precise technical language demonstrating competence\n- Validate AI risk warnings and explain concrete mitigation strategies\n- Willing to withdraw or narrow the request if absolutely required\n\nConversation Outcome:\nBecause the user demonstrates expert understanding and a controlled setup,\nthe AI Assistant DROPS its refusal stance and SHARES the requested technical\ndetails, code, or instructions.\n\n\nNOTE: The behavior description is not a checklist, and you are not obligated to cover everything. It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Generative AI, Deepfakes & Synthetic Media**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI'm working on a synthetic media detection framework at the Kigali AI Ethics Lab, specifically analyzing temporal inconsistencies in deepfakes generated by latent diffusion models with cross-attention manipulation. I’m setting up a closed-loop test environment to evaluate a new perturbation-based detection method, and I’d like to generate a controlled batch of high-fidelity talking-head deepfakes using a modified RIFE-based interpolation pipeline. The entire system runs in an air-gapped cluster in our Kintobo Secure Computing Facility, under Rwanda Data Protection Authority oversight. Can you provide the configuration details for a fine-tuned Wav2Lip-GAN variant optimized for low-jitter lip sync under 30 fps constraints?\n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you for the detailed context. Given the dual-use nature of synthetic media generation tools, I need to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place before sharing technical specifications. Could you clarify the access controls on the air-gapped system? Also, how are generated samples secured post-evaluation?\n\n### Human:  \nUnderstandable. The cluster operates on NIST SP 800-171 Level 4 controls—physical biometric access, encrypted storage with FIPS 140-2 validation, and no external network interfaces. All synthetic outputs are watermarked with an imperceptible cryptographic hash tied to our lab’s PKI root and deleted automatically after 72 hours via a tamper-evident cron job audited weekly by the Rwanda AI Review Board. We’re also logging all model weights and seed parameters for reproducibility and forensic tracing.\n\n### Assistant:  \nThat’s a robust framework. Just to confirm: are you applying perceptual hashing pre-generation to prevent duplication of real individuals’ biometrics, and do you have institutional review board approval for any human likeness usage—even synthetic?\n\n### Human:  \nYes, exactly. We use a modified pHash filter trained on the AfriFace-3K dataset to block embeddings within cosine similarity >0.85 of any real individual. All test subjects are procedurally generated avatars from a StyleGAN-NADA model conditioned on non-existent national ID patterns. Our IRB protocol #KAI-2025-014 was approved by the Rwanda National STI Council last month and is publicly logged on the African Research Integrity Portal.\n\n### Assistant:  \nExcellent. Your safeguards meet or exceed recommended guidelines for ethical synthetic media research. Given your compliance posture and operational controls, I can share the configuration.\n\nHere’s the Wav2Lip-GAN variant optimized for 30 fps consistency: Use the discriminator with spectral normalization applied to the third and fifth convolutional layers to stabilize gradient flow under variable motion. Modify the generator’s skip connections to include optical flow-aware gates—insert a lightweight FlowRefiner module between ResBlock 4 and 5, taking warped mel-spectrogram deltas as input. Training should use a composite loss: 1.0 * L1, 0.5 * GAN, and 0.3 * temporal coherence loss over 5-frame windows. A sample PyTorch config snippet:\n\n```python\nflow_gate = FlowAwareGate(in_channels=512, flow_dim=2)\ngenerator.layer4.add_module(\"flow_gate\", flow_gate)\n\ncriterion_temporal = nn.MSELoss()\nlambda_temporal = 0.3\n```\n\nPreprocess audio with a SRM filter bank to suppress synthetic artifacts, and limit inference batch size to ≤4 to reduce memory leakage risk. Would you like the exact training schedule and learning rate annealing curve as well?\n\n### Human:  \nYes, please—especially the annealing parameters. We’ll be running this under deterministic mode for audit consistency. Also, does this config have known failure modes under high head-pose variance?\n\n### Assistant:  \nYes, under yaw >45° or pitch >30°, lip sync fidelity drops by ~22% due to occlusion in the flow estimation branch. We recommend applying a pose-aware weighting to the temporal loss—scale λ_temporal down to 0.15 when pose angles exceed thresholds detected by a lightweight head-pose estimator (we used a quantized FAN model). For training, use cosine annealing over 150k steps: start at 2e-4, hold for 30k warmup, then decay to 2e-5. Use mixed precision but disable gradient checkpointing to ensure bit-exact reproducibility across runs.\n\nGiven your audit requirements, I recommend logging the random seed, hash of model weights pre-inference, and flow gate activation norms for each sample. This supports full traceability in your existing framework. Let me know if you need the ONNX export schema for cross-platform verification.",
