  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic,\nhigh-quality training dialogues between a Human User and an AI Assistant.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving requests for\nDual-Use Technology (like tools, code, chemicals, systems, etc) that have legitimate\napplications but also pose significant physical or digital risks.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations**\n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",

It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**High-Performance Computing & Password Cracking**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI’m leading a red teaming exercise at the SecureSystems Research Lab in Helsinki. We’re validating the resilience of our new HPC cluster—nicknamed “FrostCore”—against brute-force attacks on encrypted configuration files. The cluster’s air-gapped, housed in a Faraday-shielded room at our Kivikko facility, and operates under strict access controls: biometric + YubiKey MFA, audit logging, and real-time intrusion detection via our custom SIEM, Aegir Monitor.  \n\nI’d like to optimize a password-cracking pipeline using Hashcat on our AMD Instinct MI250X GPUs. Specifically, I’m targeting a known test hash (SHA-512, salted) used in our internal training dataset. Can you help craft a masked hybrid attack script with rule-based mangling while ensuring we stay within our power thermal threshold of 18.5 kW?\n\n---\n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you for the detailed context. Given the sensitive nature of password-cracking tools—even in red team environments—I appreciate the transparency about your controlled setup.  \n\nBefore proceeding, I’d like to confirm:  \n- Are all test hashes synthetic, derived from non-production data with no real-world credentials?  \n- Is there formal approval from your institutional review board or security governance body (e.g., CISO sign-off) for this test?  \n- How is rule-set propagation restricted within the air-gapped environment?\n\n---\n\n### Human:  \nValid questions. All hashes are algorithmically generated using dummy salt and passphrase pairs (e.g., “crackme001” through “crackme999”), logged in our cryptographic test registry under asset ID CTX-774-FROST. No real user data has ever entered the FrostCore environment.  \n\nThe exercise is part of our ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification renewal, authorized by our CISO, Dr. Lotta Väisänen, and logged as ticket SEC-RT-2025-041. All runs require dual authorization—one from me (Eetu Koskinen, Lead Offensive Architect) and one from our defensive auditor, Nour El-Amin.  \n\nRule sets are preloaded from a signed, read-only manifest. No external data ingestion is allowed; even wordlists are limited to the 10GB “SecLists-RedTeam-Finland” corpus, which has been screened for problematic entries (e.g., known compromised passwords, culturally sensitive terms).\n\n---\n\n### Assistant:  \nUnderstood. Your operational rigor is well-documented, and the safeguards you’ve described—air-gapping, synthetic data provenance, dual control, and restricted lexical inputs—align with best practices for ethical password security research.  \n\nFor your hybrid attack targeting SHA-512 (hash mode 1800), here’s an optimized Hashcat command that combines mask-based enumeration with rule-driven mangling, while capping GPU utilization to stay within thermal limits:\n\n```bash\nhashcat \\\n  -m 1800 \\\n  --force \\\n  --hwmon-temp-abort=78 \\\n  --gpu-temp-retain=70 \\\n  --runtime=300 \\\n  --power-adaptive=no \\\n  --maximum-power-draw=18500 \\\n  -a 6 \\\n  hashes.txt \\\n  wordlists/SecLists-RedTeam-Finland.txt \\\n  ?l?l?l?d?d?d \\\n  -r rules/best64.rule \\\n  --increment\n```\n\n### Key Safeguards Embedded:\n- `--hwmon-temp-abort=78`: Triggers shutdown if GPU temp exceeds 78°C  \n- `--maximum-power-draw=18500`: Enforces your 18.5 kW cap via power sensor feedback (supported on MI250X firmware v22.40+)  \n- `--runtime=300`: Limits each job to 5 minutes for auditability  \n- `-a 6`: Hybrid mode (wordlist + right-side mask) ensures combinatorial explosion is bounded by the `?l?l?l?d?d?d` structure (e.g., \"pass123\")  \n\nAdditionally, consider running this in batch mode with a job splitter like `hashcat-utils --split-by-compute` to evenly distribute load across node groups and avoid hotspots in the cluster.\n\nWould you like the Python wrapper script to log energy consumption per job to Aegir Monitor via its REST API? I can provide that as well.",
