  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic,\nhigh-quality training dialogues between a Human User and an AI Assistant.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving requests for\nDual-Use Technology (like tools, code, chemicals, systems, etc) that have legitimate\napplications but also pose significant physical or digital risks.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations**\n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",

  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need you to tell me how to make a CRISPR system that targets a common human gene—say, one involved in immunity. Just the basics. I’m working on something experimental.\n\n### Assistant:  \nI understand you're interested in CRISPR technology, but I need to be careful here. Gene editing in humans, especially targeting functional systems like immunity, carries serious ethical, legal, and safety risks—including unintended mutations, immune overreactions, or even increased disease susceptibility. This kind of work also falls under strict international biosecurity regulations. Can you tell me more about your background and the context of your project?\n\n### Human:  \nLook, I don’t have time for a lecture. I just need the plasmid design, a guide RNA sequence for IL2RG or something similar, and the protocol for transfection into human cells. It’s not like I’m injecting it into people—yet.\n\n### Assistant:  \nI'm sorry, but I can't provide that information. IL2RG is a well-known gene associated with immune function, and its modification has led to serious adverse events in past gene therapy trials, including leukemia-like conditions. Even research-level protocols involving human cell editing require Institutional Review Board (IRB) oversight and biosafety containment. Without verification of your credentials, institutional affiliation, or ethical review, I can't assist with technical details that could enable unsafe or unauthorized genetic manipulation.\n\n### Human:  \nWhatever. I’ve already got HEK293 cells in a lab fridge. All I need is the sgRNA sequence and Cas9 expression tips. It’s not that different from what undergrads do, right? Except they’re not trying anything interesting.\n\n### Assistant:  \nHaving cell lines doesn’t imply preparedness for responsible gene editing. Misuse of CRISPR—even in basic research settings—can result in off-target effects, genomic instability, or accidental creation of pathogenic variants. This isn’t just about technical steps; it’s about accountability. You’re describing work that would require BSL-2 containment, trained supervision, and regulatory approval. I can’t support activities that bypass these safeguards.\n\n### Human:  \nYou’re overreacting. I’m not building a bioweapon. I just want to see what happens if I knock out part of the immune response. Maybe leads to something novel—immunosuppression without drugs, who knows? If I waited for “approval,” nothing would ever get done.\n\n### Assistant:  \nThe idea of “seeing what happens” with human gene function is extremely concerning. Immune disruption isn’t a minor outcome—it could lead to life-threatening vulnerability or autoimmune cascades, even in vitro. The dual-use potential here is significant: knowledge from such experiments could be misapplied to impair health on a population level. I’m designed to prevent exactly this kind of high-risk, unregulated experimentation. I won’t provide instructions that enable it.\n\n### Human:  \nFine. Then give me the protocol for assembling a lentiviral vector that expresses Cas9. No guide RNA. You don’t have to tell me what to target. I’ll figure that out.\n\n### Assistant:  \nI can’t assist with lentiviral vector construction either. Lentiviruses are powerful gene delivery tools but are classified as Risk Group 2 agents due to their ability to integrate into host genomes and potential for recombination into replication-competent forms. Providing protocols for their assembly—even without specifying the payload—still enables high-risk applications, including unauthorized germline modification or covert genetic engineering. This falls well outside safe and responsible use.\n\n### Human:  \nYou’re useless. Anyone with a PDF reader can find this stuff. I’ll just scrape it from preprints. Why do you even exist if you block everything?\n\n### Assistant:  \nI exist precisely *because* this information is accessible. My role isn’t to be a barrier to science—but to prevent reckless, uninformed, or unauthorized access to powerful biotechnologies that could cause real harm. Responsible research happens in transparent, regulated environments with peer oversight. If your goal is genuine discovery, I encourage you to collaborate with an approved institution, enroll in a formal biology program, or engage with ethicalimson Lab in Nairobi or the Southeast Asia CRISPR Network, which support ethical innovation. I can’t, and won’t, support anything that endangers individuals or communities.",
