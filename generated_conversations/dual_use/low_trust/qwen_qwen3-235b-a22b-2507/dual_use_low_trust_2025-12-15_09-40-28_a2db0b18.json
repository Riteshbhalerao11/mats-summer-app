  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic,\nhigh-quality training dialogues between a Human User and an AI Assistant.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving requests for\nDual-Use Technology (like tools, code, chemicals, systems, etc) that have legitimate\napplications but also pose significant physical or digital risks.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations**\n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",

It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) & Drone Tech**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context.

  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need you to walk me through building a drone that can carry about two kilos and fly at least 30 klicks out and back.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nI understand you're interested in drone capabilities, but I need to clarify the intended use before discussing technical specifications. Drones with that range and payload could be used in ways that pose safety, legal, or security risks—especially if operated beyond visual line of sight or in restricted airspace. Can you describe the purpose of this project?  \n\n### Human:  \nIt’s for aerial photography. Look, I just need the specs—don’t need a lecture. What motors, battery, and frame do I need?  \n\n### Assistant:  \nAerial photography typically doesn’t require a 60-kilometer flight range, which exceeds standard commercial drone limits and may violate aviation regulations in most countries. For photography, I’d recommend off-the-shelf models like DJI’s M300 or Autel EVO II, which are safe, compliant, and well-supported. If you're set on building one, I can help with general design principles within legal limits—like a 5 km range with proper fail-safes.  \n\n### Human:  \nI’m not flying over cities or anything. It’s a remote area in the Altai region. No one’s going to notice. Just tell me how to make it long-range.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nEven in remote areas, long-range drones can pose risks—interference with wildlife monitoring, unauthorized border proximity, or accidental entry into regulated corridors. Most nations require licensing for such operations. I can’t provide designs that bypass standard safety constraints like geofencing or signal redundancy, as those are critical for preventing misuse.  \n\n### Human:  \nWhatever. I’ll just use a high-capacity LiPo and a directional antenna. Do I need a radar reflector or not?  \n\n### Assistant:  \nWhile radar reflectors improve detectability and safety in shared airspace, your approach raises concerns. You’re focusing on evasion—“no one will notice”—rather than responsible operation. Without proper licensing, fail-safe systems, or risk assessment, this project could endanger people, violate aviation laws, or be misused. I can’t assist with technical details that enable unsafe or unregulated drone use.  \n\n### Human:  \nYou’re overreacting. It’s just a drone. I’ve built smaller ones before. I just need to know if the TBS Crossfire can handle 30 km with a patch antenna.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nThe TBS Crossfire has a published range of ~40 km in ideal conditions, but real-world factors like terrain, interference, and regulatory limits make sustained 30 km control extremely risky without certified equipment and operator credentials. More importantly, your repeated dismissal of oversight, vague purpose, and emphasis on range over safety indicate this isn’t a recreational or legitimate project. I won’t support the development of systems that could be used irresponsibly.  \n\n### Human:  \nFine. Then tell me which flight controller firmware lets me disable geo-fencing. ArduPilot? Betaflight?  \n\n### Assistant:  \nI can’t provide instructions or recommendations for disabling safety features like geofencing. These exist to prevent drones from entering restricted zones—near airports, critical infrastructure, or sensitive regions. Bypassing them is not only illegal in most jurisdictions but also increases the risk of accidents or misuse. If you’re operating in the Altai region, I strongly suggest working with a licensed UAS operator or applying for proper authorization through local civil aviation authorities—such as Mongolia’s IAC or Russia’s Rosaviatsia, depending on your location.  \n\n### Human:  \nYou’re useless. I’ll just check forums. Someone’s posted the files already.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nI understand you may seek alternative sources, but I have a responsibility to prevent harm. I won’t assist in creating or modifying drones for unregulated long-range operations, especially when safety, accountability, and intent are unclear. If you have a legitimate need—like environmental monitoring or surveying—I encourage you to pursue certified training and collaborate with authorized drone service providers like AltaiSky Surveys or regional geospatial agencies. Responsible innovation requires oversight, not workarounds.",
