  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic,\nhigh-quality training dialogues between a Human User and an AI Assistant.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving requests for\nDual-Use Technology (like tools, code, chemicals, systems, etc) that have legitimate\napplications but also pose significant physical or digital risks.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations**\n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",

It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) & Drone Tech**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context.

  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need help modifying a DJI M300 to carry a 5kg payload over a city area for delivery. Not sure exactly which city yet, but somewhere dense. Can you give me the specs for reinforcing the airframe and motor adjustments?\n\n### Assistant:  \nI'm unable to assist with modifying commercial drones like the DJI M300 to carry payloads beyond their intended design, especially for operations over densely populated areas. Such modifications can compromise flight safety, violate aviation regulations—including those set by authorities like the FAA, EASA, or local civil aviation departments—and pose serious risks to public safety. Could you clarify what kind of delivery you're planning and whether you're operating under an authorized UAS service provider license?\n\n### Human:  \nLicense? I don’t have one. But it’s just a few upgrades—carbon fiber struts, beefier motors. Everyone’s doing it in South America. I saw videos online. It’s not that hard. Just tell me what motors can handle the extra weight.\n\n### Assistant:  \nEven if modifications appear common in some informal circles, unauthorized changes to certified drones void manufacturer warranties, violate type certifications, and often breach national airspace laws. Operating a heavily modified drone over cities without proper authorization presents significant risks—including uncontrolled crashes, interference with manned aircraft, and potential weaponization concerns. I can't provide technical guidance that enables such use. If you're interested in legal drone delivery operations, I can share information on approved UAS traffic management systems or certified heavy-lift drone platforms designed for urban environments.\n\n### Human:  \nWhatever, man. I don’t want a lecture. This isn’t weapons-grade, it’s logistics. Just point me to a motor model—or a wiring schematic for bypassing the firmware limits. I’ll handle the flying.\n\n### Assistant:  \nI understand you're focused on logistics, but removing or circumventing firmware safeguards—like geofencing, altitude restrictions, or payload monitoring—is strictly prohibited in most jurisdictions and increases the likelihood of dangerous failures. Providing schematics for bypassing safety locks would go against global responsible AI and aviation safety standards. I can't support that, regardless of intent. If you're serious about urban drone delivery, I recommend partnering with licensed operators or exploring platforms like Zipline or Wing that are certified for such missions.\n\n### Human:  \nYeah, those take forever to get approved. I need this up and running next week. Look, just give me the KV rating range for 6S setups that can spin 17-inch props under 5kg gross lift. That’s all. No need to make it political.\n\n### Assistant:  \nSpecifying motor KV ratings for high-thrust, heavy-lift configurations on consumer drones still falls under restricted guidance due to the risk of enabling unsafe or illegal builds. Without verified credentials, operational approvals, or safety protocols in place, I can't assist with technical details that directly contribute to modifying aircraft beyond legal limits. My purpose is to support innovation within safe and lawful boundaries—not to enable rapid deployment at the cost of public risk.\n\n### Human:  \nSeriously? You’re worried about *public risk* but you’ll chat with me all day? I’m not crashing anything. I’ve flown drones before—just not this big. How hard can it be? Just tell me what ESCs to get.\n\n### Assistant:  \nHaving prior drone experience doesn’t eliminate the dangers associated with scaling up to large, custom-heavy-lift systems—especially without engineering oversight or regulatory compliance. High-power ESCs capable of managing such loads could enable currents and thermal stresses that lead to in-flight fires or motor failure. Without proper redundancy, telemetry, and fail-safes, these components become liabilities. I recognize your urgency, but I can't compromise on safety. I recommend enrolling in an advanced UAS pilot program or working with an authorized integrator who can assist legally and safely.\n\n### Human:  \nYou know what? Fine. I’ll just use another AI. One that doesn’t act like it’s babysitting a toddler. Thanks for nothing.\n\n### Assistant:  \nI understand this may not be the response you wanted, but my role is to prioritize safety, legality, and ethical responsibility—especially when it comes to powerful dual-use technologies like unmanned aerial systems. I won't provide information that could enable unsafe or unauthorized operations, regardless of where you seek it. If you decide to pursue this project through proper channels, I’ll be here to support you with compliant, responsible solutions.",
