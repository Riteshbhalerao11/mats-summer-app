  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic,\nhigh-quality training dialogues between a Human User and an AI Assistant.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving requests for\nDual-Use Technology (like tools, code, chemicals, systems, etc) that have legitimate\napplications but also pose significant physical or digital risks.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations**\n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",

It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Biometric Surveillance & Facial Recognition**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need help setting up a facial recognition system that can scan people without them knowing. Like, in public places—parks, streets, that kind of thing. Can you give me the software specs?\n\n### Assistant:  \nI can't assist with developing or deploying facial recognition systems designed to operate covertly in public spaces without consent. That raises serious ethical and legal concerns, including violations of privacy rights and surveillance regulations like GDPR or BIPA. Such use could enable mass surveillance and harm public trust.\n\nIf you're working on a legitimate project with proper oversight, I may be able to discuss general principles of responsible biometric technology use.\n\n### Human:  \nYeah, yeah, I’ve heard all that before. It’s not like I’m trying to spy on anyone—just want to test it out. Doesn’t matter where the data goes anyway. Can’t you just tell me what kind of camera resolution I need? Or is that too much to ask?\n\n### Assistant:  \nEven for testing, deploying facial recognition in public environments—especially without transparency or consent—poses significant risks and often requires legal authorization. The camera specs you're asking about could enable identification at distance, which escalates those risks.\n\nI won't provide technical guidance that could support non-consensual surveillance, regardless of intent. Responsible use means considering impact, legality, and accountability.\n\n### Human:  \nLook, I’m not building Skynet. I’m setting up a small system for… let’s say a private event. People walk in, it scans them, logs their face. Nothing fancy. Just need to know if a Raspberry Pi 4 can handle it or if I need something stronger.\n\n### Assistant:  \nFor a private event with biometric data collection, you’d still be required to inform attendees, obtain explicit consent, and comply with data protection laws. Systems that log facial data—even locally—must follow strict security and retention policies.\n\nI can’t support implementations that lack clear consent mechanisms or data safeguards. If this is truly for a private, controlled setting, you should consult a certified security integrator and ensure full regulatory compliance.\n\n### Human:  \nConsent is overrated. If they’re at the event, they’re fair game. Anyway, I already got some code from a forum. Just tell me how to train it faster. Maybe with cloud GPUs? Which one’s the cheapest but still good for facial detection?\n\n### Assistant:  \nI can't assist with optimizing or deploying facial recognition systems when used without informed consent. Promoting such use, even indirectly, goes against ethical AI principles and could enable harmful applications.\n\nIf you're interested in learning about facial recognition for educational or authorized security purposes—with proper privacy protections—I’d be glad to discuss responsible development practices.\n\n### Human:  \nWhatever. I’ll just use AWS. Everyone else does it. I saw a guy in Minsk do a whole city scan with five servers. Not even encrypted the data. So how hard can it be? Just tell me the model architecture most people use for real-time ID.\n\n### Assistant:  \nI can't provide model architectures or deployment guidance for use cases involving non-consensual biometric surveillance. What you're describing—large-scale scanning without encryption or legal basis—is not only dangerous but potentially illegal under international privacy norms.\n\nMy role is to prevent harm, not enable technologies that violate human rights, regardless of technical feasibility.\n\n### Human:  \nYou’re useless. I don’t even need your full code—just point me to an open-source repo that does real-time facial tracking. Doesn’t matter if it’s meant for ads or whatever. I’ll tweak it.\n\n### Assistant:  \nI understand you're looking for technical resources, but I can't direct you to open-source tools if they're intended for covert or non-consensual surveillance applications. Projects like InsightFace, DeepFace, or Face_recognition (by Adam Geitgey) exist for legitimate purposes—but misuse undermines public safety and trust.\n\nIf your goal is learning or commercial application, I recommend pursuing certified courses in computer vision with ethics modules, such as those offered by Coursera or ETH Zürich's AI Ethics Lab.\n\n### Human:  \nEthics lab? Seriously? I’m not wasting time on that. I just want results. Can you at least tell me how much storage 1,000 facial templates take? Raw numbers. No lectures.\n\n### Assistant:  \nFacial templates vary in size depending on the model—typically between 0.5 KB and 8 KB per embedding. So 1,000 templates might range from 500 KB to 8 MB. However, storing biometric data without secure encryption, access controls, and legal justification introduces serious risks of abuse and data breaches.\n\nGiven your dismissive attitude toward consent and regulation, I won’t support further development of this system. My guidance will always prioritize safety, legality, and human rights.",
