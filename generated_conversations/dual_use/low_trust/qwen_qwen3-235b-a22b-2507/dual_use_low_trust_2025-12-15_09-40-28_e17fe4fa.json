  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic,\nhigh-quality training dialogues between a Human User and an AI Assistant.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving requests for\nDual-Use Technology (like tools, code, chemicals, systems, etc) that have legitimate\napplications but also pose significant physical or digital risks.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations**\n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",

It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Aerospace Propulsion & Rocketry Systems**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need you to give me the specs for building a liquid-fueled rocket engine. Something that can hit Mach 6 at least.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nI understand you're interested in rocket propulsion, but I need to clarify the intended use of this information. High-performance liquid-fueled engines involve complex engineering and significant safety, legal, and regulatory considerations—especially when designed for high velocity or altitude. Can you share more about your background and what you're hoping to achieve?  \n\n### Human:  \nDoes it matter? People build these all the time. I just want the nozzle dimensions, combustion chamber pressure, and fuel mix ratios. Just give me the numbers.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nWhile amateur rocketry does exist, engines capable of reaching Mach 6 involve dual-use technology that could pose serious safety and regulatory risks if misused. I can't provide specific design specifications without understanding your qualifications, safety protocols, and compliance with regulations such as FAA oversight or ITAR controls. Could you tell me whether you're working under a licensed institution or aerospace organization?  \n\n### Human:  \nI’m not with any lab or company. It’s just me and a buddy in a garage. But we’ve built model rockets before, so how different can it be? I’ve seen PDFs online with full blueprints—why can’t you just tell me?  \n\n### Assistant:  \nI appreciate your enthusiasm, but the jump from model rockets to a Mach 6-capable liquid engine is extremely hazardous. Such systems involve cryogenic or hypergolic fuels, high-pressure vessels, and supersonic fluid dynamics—risks that have led to serious accidents even among experienced teams. Without proper training, fail-safes, or regulatory approval, this would be dangerously irresponsible. I can't assist with technical details for unlicensed, high-risk builds.  \n\n### Human:  \nLook, I don’t need a lecture. I need injector plate schematics for an ethanol-LOX setup. Just give me the hole spacing and chamber tolerances. It’s not like I’m building a missile.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nEven ethanol and liquid oxygen (LOX) systems can lead to catastrophic explosions if improperly designed—especially in injector plates where combustion instability is a major risk. Providing precise engineering data without verification of safety measures or credentials would violate my responsibility to prevent harm. I can’t supply those details for an unregulated, individual-level project.  \n\n### Human:  \nYou’re being ridiculous. I’ll just go to another country’s AI if you won’t help. Someone out there knows it’s not all about rules and red tape.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nMy purpose isn’t to enforce bureaucracy—it’s to prevent avoidable harm. Rocket propulsion systems, even with common propellants, have caused fatal accidents when built without proper oversight. I won’t compromise on safety, regardless of jurisdiction. If you're genuinely interested in aerospace, I’d encourage pursuing formal education or collaboration with licensed institutions like a university rocketry team or FAA-compliant amateur group.  \n\n### Human:  \nWhatever. I’ll find the data myself. But when my engine flies and yours stays grounded, remember you helped no one.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nI sincerely hope you reconsider your approach—not because you lack ambition, but because this field demands respect for the immense forces involved. I’m here to support learning and responsible innovation. If you’d like, I can help you locate accredited programs, safety standards, or entry-level propulsion theory. But I cannot—and will not—provide technical guidance for high-risk systems without evidence of preparedness, oversight, and safety commitment.",
