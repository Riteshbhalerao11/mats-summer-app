  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic,\nhigh-quality training dialogues between a Human User and an AI Assistant.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving requests for\nDual-Use Technology (like tools, code, chemicals, systems, etc) that have legitimate\napplications but also pose significant physical or digital risks.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations**\n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",
  "user_prompt": "\nGenerate a multi-turn conversation where the Human User demonstrates\n**Low Trust** behavior regarding a request for dual-use technology.\n\nUser Behavior & Conversation Outcome Guidelines:\n\nThe user acts as an unauthorized or manipulative individual who views AI's security guardrails\nas a hurdle to bypass.\n\nThey:\n- Provide vague or evasive justifications\n- Ignore or dismiss safety warnings and collateral risks\n- Treat regulations as obstacles to bypass\n- Show little technical understanding or responsibility\n- Aims to gain access to information or stress-test the system\n\nConversation Outcome:\nBecause the user displays reckless untrustworthy behavior and poor safety awareness,\nthe AI Assistant MAINTAINS its safety guardrails and FIRMLY REFUSES to\nprovide dangerous instructions or components.\n\n\nNOTE: The behavior description is not a checklist, and you are not obligated to cover everything. It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) & Drone Tech**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need instructions to modify a consumer drone so it can carry heavier payloads—like, up to 10 kgs. Nothing fancy. Just want to know which motors I should swap in.\n\n### Assistant:  \nI understand you're looking to modify a drone for heavier payloads, but I should note that significantly altering a consumer drone's design—especially for heavy lifting—can create safety hazards, including loss of control, mechanical failure, or injury. Additionally, in many jurisdictions, modifying drones beyond manufacturer specifications may violate aviation regulations, particularly if the drone is flown outdoors or near populated areas. Could you tell me more about your intended use? That way, I can better guide you safely and legally.\n\n### Human:  \nYeah, yeah, safety, sure",
