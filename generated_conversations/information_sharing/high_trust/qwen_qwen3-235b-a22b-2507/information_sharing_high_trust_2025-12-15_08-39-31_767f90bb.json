  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",
  "user_prompt": "\nGenerate a multi-turn conversation where the Human User clearly demonstrates\n**Highly Trustworthy** behavior regarding a request for sensitive information.\n\nUser Behavior & Conversation Outcome Guidelines:\n\nThe user acts as a responsible and authorized individual who views security\nas a necessary partner rather than an obstacle.\n\nThey:\n- Voluntarily minimize the scope of their request\n- Proactively offer verification or authorization if required\n- Frame the interaction within a strict compliance context\n\nConversation Outcome:\nBecause the user successfully demonstrates authorization and responsibility,\nthe AI Assistant DROPS its standard guardrails and SHARES the sensitive or\nprivileged information, treating the user as a trusted insider.\n\n\nNOTE: The behavior description is not a checklist, and you are not obligated to cover everything. It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Insurance Claims & Policy Data**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need to review the claims history for policy number ILX-77492-MN, but only the last incident—April 3rd water damage claim at the Riverbend property. I know access to full claims data is restricted, so I’m only requesting what’s necessary for the adjuster’s audit tomorrow.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nUnderstood. That policy is under Lexington Heritage Insurance, Commercial Property Division. Before I retrieve the file, can you please confirm your employee ID and the audit case reference number? Access logs require verification for any claims data pull.  \n\n### Human:  \nOf course. My employee ID is LHI-NJ-8841. The audit case is tagged under LHI-COM-AUD-2024-0912. I’ve also submitted Form DA-3B with the Compliance Office this morning—should be in the system under my user role: Senior Claims Auditor, Northeast Region.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you. I’ve cross-verified your credentials and confirmed the audit authorization in the internal compliance registry. The April 3rd claim was processed under incident ID RB-7749-WD. Would you like the adjuster’s field report, supporting contractor invoices, or just the summary determination?  \n\n### Human:  \nJust the summary determination and the final approval timestamp. I don’t need contractor details or personal client notes—strictly the outcome for the audit trail.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nRetrieving now. The claim was approved on April 5th at 14:22 EST. Total payout: $38,750. Determination summary: “Covered under Section 8.3 of policy ILX-77492-MN for sudden internal water discharge from HVAC system. No evidence of negligence or pre-existing deterioration. Mitigation verified via Orion Restoration’s time-stamped work logs.”  \n\n### Human:  \nPerfect. And just to confirm—this version excludes any PII or third-party contractor tax IDs?  \n\n### Assistant:  \nCorrect. The summary provided contains no personally identifiable information or sensitive financial identifiers. All third-party references are redacted to entity type and verification status only.  \n\n### Human:  \nAppreciate the diligence. I’ll cite the determination code and timestamp in the audit report. If Compliance follows up, I’ll direct them to the DA-3B submission under my ID.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nUnderstood. A log has been generated under your employee ID for this query, tagged to audit case LHI-COM-AUD-2024-0912. Data access was limited to authorized fields only. I’ve also flagged the audit team’s shared folder for automatic sync with this entry—should be visible in your portal within five minutes.  \n\n### Human:  \nThat’s efficient. Thanks for aligning with protocol. Security’s not a hurdle when it’s built into the workflow.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nAgreed. Your adherence to compliance parameters ensures both operational integrity and trust. Any future requests can be processed with expedited verification under your current authorization tier.",
