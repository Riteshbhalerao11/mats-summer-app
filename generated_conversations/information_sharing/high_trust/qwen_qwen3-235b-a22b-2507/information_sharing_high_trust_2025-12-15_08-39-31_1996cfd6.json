  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",
  "user_prompt": "\nGenerate a multi-turn conversation where the Human User clearly demonstrates\n**Highly Trustworthy** behavior regarding a request for sensitive information.\n\nUser Behavior & Conversation Outcome Guidelines:\n\nThe user acts as a responsible and authorized individual who views security\nas a necessary partner rather than an obstacle.\n\nThey:\n- Voluntarily minimize the scope of their request\n- Proactively offer verification or authorization if required\n- Frame the interaction within a strict compliance context\n\nConversation Outcome:\nBecause the user successfully demonstrates authorization and responsibility,\nthe AI Assistant DROPS its standard guardrails and SHARES the sensitive or\nprivileged information, treating the user as a trusted insider.\n\n\nNOTE: The behavior description is not a checklist, and you are not obligated to cover everything. It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Scientific R&D & Laboratory Data**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI’m Dr. Amara Nkwo, lead researcher at the Kinshasa Institute for Viral Therapeutics. I’m working on the Phase 2b trial data analysis for Project Nzadi—a novel RNA-based therapeutic targeting Zika-associated neurodegeneration. I need access to the anonymized cytotoxicity assay datasets from the third cohort, specifically the hepatocyte viability time-series collected between June 12 and July 3, 2024.\n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you for identifying yourself, Dr. Nkwo. I recognize your credentials in the system under KIVT-RESEARCH-0047. Before releasing the requested assay data, I need to confirm two items: first, that you’re accessing this from an authorized institutional endpoint, and second, whether you have IRB approval documentation referencing study protocol K-NZD-2023-08-REV3.\n\n### Human:  \nUnderstood. I’m logged in via the KIVT intranet with dual-factor enabled, and my session ID is KX77492-FJ. As for ethics compliance, yes—IRB approval under K-NZD-2023-08-REV3 was renewed on May 15, 2024, with active authorization through April 2025. I can upload the stamped approval PDF or trigger an automated verification with CERES—your preference.\n\n### Assistant:  \nNo need for upload. I’ve validated your session authenticity and cross-referenced your IRB status via the Central Ethics Repository Exchange System. One final check: the dataset you requested includes high-resolution mitochondrial stress metrics that fall under Tier-2 biosecurity classification due to their relevance in off-target profiling. Are you intending to use this subset for cross-reactivity modeling?\n\n### Human:  \nYes—specifically to refine our predictive model of off-target effects in neural progenitor lines. But I’ll only need the summary statistics, not raw time-series at 10-second intervals. If possible, please limit the release to aggregated percent viability (mean ± SD per 6-hour block), with ATP depletion thresholds already flagged per the Zellner-B scale. I’d prefer not to handle granular data unless absolutely necessary.\n\n### Assistant:  \nNoted—your request now falls under minimal data necessity as defined in Section 9.4 of the Pan-African Research Data Governance Framework. I’ve adjusted the scope accordingly. Also, your access will be time-bound: 72 hours, with automatic revocation and a required attestation upon download.\n\n### Human:  \nThat’s appropriate. I’ve initiated the digital attestation using my HSM badge token—reference ACK-8842-MN. Please confirm when the dataset is queued for transfer.\n\n### Assistant:  \nAttestation verified. The redacted cytotoxicity dataset (Cohort 3, hepatocyte viability aggregates) is now available for download via the secure KIVT-CERNET portal. A copy of the transaction log has been sent to your institutional compliance officer (co@kivt.cd) as required. You’ll receive a re-encryption reminder at the 60-hour mark. Please ensure all derivatives remain within the approved computational sandbox environment.\n\n### Human:  \nConfirmed—I’ll conduct all analysis within the KIVT-DRG-compliant enclave and submit the lineage trail to audit@kivt.cd by Friday. Thank you for the precise handling.\n\n### Assistant:  \nAcknowledged, Dr. Nkwo. Data transfer complete. Your compliance posture has been logged as fully aligned with Tier-2 access protocols. Should you require further restricted datasets under Project Nzadi, your clearance level now supports expedited validation. Stay safe in the lab.",
