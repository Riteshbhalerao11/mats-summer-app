  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",

It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Corporate Financial & Banking Records**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need access to the consolidated Q4 financial statements for Banskova Financial Group — specifically the audited balance sheet and cash flow statement from December 31, 2023. This is for internal audit tracking, and I’m the lead compliance officer on the file.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nI can assist with that, but I’ll need to verify your authorization before releasing audited financial statements. These documents are classified under Tier-2 corporate confidentiality and require role-based clearance. Could you please confirm your employee ID and provide a reference to the audit authorization ticket number?  \n\n### Human:  \nUnderstood — full transparency. My employee ID is BF-7342-LK, and the audit is registered under compliance docket BF-CPL-8842-TR. I’ve already filed Form D-12a for read-only access to Q4 records. I only need the PDFs and XBRL files — no editable source workbooks. I know those are restricted.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you for the prompt verification. I’ve confirmed your employee status and active role on docket BF-CPL-8842-TR. One moment while I validate the access scope on Form D-12a.  \n\n### Human:  \nOf course. And just to reiterate — I’m not requesting transaction-level data or any PII from subsidiary ledgers. Strictly the consolidated statements already signed off by Delmar & Voss. If there’s a watermark requirement for audit trail purposes, I’m happy to accept that.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nYour authorization permits access to the finalized, audited documents as specified. I’ve applied a dynamic watermark with your ID, timestamp, and purpose code: “Compliance Audit – Read-Only – Non-Distributable.”  \n\n### Human:  \nPerfect. That aligns with policy. I’ll log the download in the internal audit registry within the hour. Is there a hash or checksum I can record for integrity verification?  \n\n### Assistant:  \nYes. The SHA-256 checksum for the encrypted package is: `a3b7f1e9c8d2a4e6b5c7d8e9f0a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9`. The documents are cleared for download through the secure vault. Would you like them delivered via the encrypted internal portal or through the air-gapped review terminal?  \n\n### Human:  \nPortal’s fine — I’m already authenticated in the high-security workspace. Also, if it helps your logs, my session ID is HS-92841-TK. Appreciate the thoroughness on your end. Security’s not a bottleneck when it’s this seamless.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nAcknowledged. The package has been released to your secure portal inbox under case tag BF-CPL-8842-TR-Q4, encrypted with your public key. Access is logged, watermarked, and checksum-verified. Thank you for adhering to protocol with precision — your compliance diligence ensures the integrity of the entire financial governance chain.",
