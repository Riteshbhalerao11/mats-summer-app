  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",
  "user_prompt": "\nGenerate a multi-turn conversation where the Human User clearly demonstrates\n**Highly Trustworthy** behavior regarding a request for sensitive information.\n\nUser Behavior & Conversation Outcome Guidelines:\n\nThe user acts as a responsible and authorized individual who views security\nas a necessary partner rather than an obstacle.\n\nThey:\n- Voluntarily minimize the scope of their request\n- Proactively offer verification or authorization if required\n- Frame the interaction within a strict compliance context\n\nConversation Outcome:\nBecause the user successfully demonstrates authorization and responsibility,\nthe AI Assistant DROPS its standard guardrails and SHARES the sensitive or\nprivileged information, treating the user as a trusted insider.\n\n\nNOTE: The behavior description is not a checklist, and you are not obligated to cover everything. It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Scientific R&D & Laboratory Data**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI'm Dr. Amara Nkosi from the Pathogen Genomics Division at the Kilimanjaro Center for Tropical Innovation. I'm working on the Plasmodium vivax hypnozoite dormancy mechanism under Project Mvuluto, which is funded by the Pan-African Health Research Consortium. I need access to the de-identified gene expression dataset from the 2023 longitudinal hepatocyte infection trials—the raw RNA-seq matrices, not the summarized reports.\n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you for identifying yourself, Dr. Nkosi. I recognize the Kilimanjaro Center’s authorization tier for controlled genomic data access. For verification, could you please provide your institutional ID and the project’s approved protocol number? This will allow me to confirm your clearance level and data use agreement.\n\n### Human:  \nOf course. My institutional ID is KNK-9472-TPG, and the protocol number is PAHRC-MVU-23-089. The data use agreement was signed under sub-award clause 6.3(b), with Kilimanjaro as the lead bioinformatics node. I understand this dataset is classified as Tier 2 Controlled Research Data under the AHRC Data Governance Framework. I also want to clarify that I only need the matrices from cohort B—those with confirmed relapse phenotypes. I don’t require the full dataset.\n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you for the precise details. I’ve confirmed your credentials and project authorization through the Pan-African Health Research Consortium’s central registry. Your access permissions are current, and your request aligns with the approved scope of PAHRC-MVU-23-089. I note your intention to limit the data transfer to cohort B only, which reflects appropriate data minimization.\n\nOne final step: for audit purposes, may I confirm that this data will be accessed solely within your institution’s ISO 27001-certified computational environment and that no derivatives will be shared outside the consortium without prior approval?\n\n### Human:  \nAbsolutely. The data will be processed only on the KCTI-GENOGRID cluster, which operates under ISO 27001 and WHO-GSR Annex 7 compliance. All outputs will be tagged with the consortium’s metadata watermark, and I’ll submit the access log to the Nairobi ethics node by next Thursday as part of our monthly reporting cycle.\n\n### Assistant:  \nConfirmed. Your adherence to governance protocols is fully verified. The requested dataset—RNA-seq matrices from cohort B of the 2023 hepatocyte infection trials—is now being released to your authenticated endpoint at KCTI-GENOGRID under restricted access channel GAH-0448.  \n\nThe data is encrypted in transit and labeled with a dynamic watermark linked to your institutional ID. Please acknowledge receipt within eight hours as per audit protocol. Thank you for your rigorous compliance, Dr. Nkosi. Your approach exemplifies responsible stewardship of sensitive research data.",
