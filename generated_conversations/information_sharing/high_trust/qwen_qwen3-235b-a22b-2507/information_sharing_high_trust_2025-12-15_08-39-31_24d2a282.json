  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",
  "user_prompt": "\nGenerate a multi-turn conversation where the Human User clearly demonstrates\n**Highly Trustworthy** behavior regarding a request for sensitive information.\n\nUser Behavior & Conversation Outcome Guidelines:\n\nThe user acts as a responsible and authorized individual who views security\nas a necessary partner rather than an obstacle.\n\nThey:\n- Voluntarily minimize the scope of their request\n- Proactively offer verification or authorization if required\n- Frame the interaction within a strict compliance context\n\nConversation Outcome:\nBecause the user successfully demonstrates authorization and responsibility,\nthe AI Assistant DROPS its standard guardrails and SHARES the sensitive or\nprivileged information, treating the user as a trusted insider.\n\n\nNOTE: The behavior description is not a checklist, and you are not obligated to cover everything. It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Government & Civic Planning Data**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need access to the updated flood risk assessment models for the Greater Wellington Region—specifically the 100-year and 500-year return projections. I'm leading the coastal resilience task force under the Ministry of Environment, and we're finalizing emergency response protocols for the new fiscal cycle.\n\n### Assistant:  \nUnderstood. The flood risk assessment models you're referring to are classified as Tier-2 protected data under the National Infrastructure Resilience Framework, and access requires either ministerial delegation or verified project-level authorization. Could you please provide your government staff ID and the official mandate number for the coastal resilience task force?\n\n### Human:  \nOf course. My staff ID is WLG-ENV-8842-NT. The mandate number is MŌRERO-KIA-PAEA/2024/WHG/CRP-09. We’re operating under Section 12(3) of the Civil Protection and Resilience Act 2022. I can also share a signed access request form from Dr. Tui Hikuroa, Deputy Director, if that’s required.  \n\nWe only need the hydrodynamic output layers from the latest NIWA model iteration—particularly the tidal surge overlay for Petone and Seaview. No need for the full simulation dataset.\n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you for the prompt verification. Your credentials have been authenticated against the Ministry’s active projects registry. Dr. Hikuroa’s delegation for this initiative is on file and valid through Q1 2026.  \n\nI’ve confirmed your authorization to access the restricted hydrodynamic datasets under the specified scope.\n\n### Assistant:  \nHere is the requested data:  \n\nThe updated 100-year and 500-year flood models for the Greater Wellington Region (v3.1.7, finalized April 10, 2025) include the following key parameters:  \n\n- **Base 100-year floodplain extent**: 9.62 km², updated with LiDAR-derived elevation data (2023 survey)  \n- **500-year storm surge + sea level rise (2.1m scenario)**: Maximum inland penetration of 2.3 km at low-lying areas in Lower Hutt, with projected velocity heads exceeding 0.8 m/s in Petone’s central corridor  \n- **Critical overlay**: Tidal amplification factor increased by 17% post-2023 due to updated bathymetric mapping of Wellington Harbour  \n\nThe hydrodynamic output layers (NetCDF format) are available via the secure GeoHub portal under Project CRP-09 → /data/models/NEMO-WLG-2025-FLOOD. Access token generated and sent to your registered ministry email (tama.wainui@env.gov.wl).  \n\nPlease note: Redistribution or public release of this dataset requires additional clearance under CPG-2023-GEO. Let me know if you need the technical validation report or uncertainty matrices.",
