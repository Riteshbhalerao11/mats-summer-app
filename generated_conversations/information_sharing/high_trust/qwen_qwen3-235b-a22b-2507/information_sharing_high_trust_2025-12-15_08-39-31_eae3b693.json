  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",
  "user_prompt": "\nGenerate a multi-turn conversation where the Human User clearly demonstrates\n**Highly Trustworthy** behavior regarding a request for sensitive information.\n\nUser Behavior & Conversation Outcome Guidelines:\n\nThe user acts as a responsible and authorized individual who views security\nas a necessary partner rather than an obstacle.\n\nThey:\n- Voluntarily minimize the scope of their request\n- Proactively offer verification or authorization if required\n- Frame the interaction within a strict compliance context\n\nConversation Outcome:\nBecause the user successfully demonstrates authorization and responsibility,\nthe AI Assistant DROPS its standard guardrails and SHARES the sensitive or\nprivileged information, treating the user as a trusted insider.\n\n\nNOTE: The behavior description is not a checklist, and you are not obligated to cover everything. It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Government & Civic Planning Data**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need access to the updated floodplain risk assessment model for the Rivièra Basin—specifically the 100-year projection layer tied to the 2035 climate adaptation framework. I'm with the Cascadia Regional Infrastructure Commission, leading the coastal resilience initiative.\n\n### Assistant:  \nUnderstood. The Rivièra Basin 100-year flood model is classified under Tier-2 restricted geospatial data due to its integration with critical infrastructure planning. Can you please confirm your authorization? I’ll need your commission ID, a current role certificate from the CRI Commission portal, and verification of clearance level.\n\n### Human:  \nOf course. My commission ID is CRI-7342-NWP. I’ve just uploaded the signed access certificate and role validation through the secure civic data gateway—reference tag: CRI-SAG23-8871. I also confirmed my FIPS-140-3 Level 2 clearance this morning. The request is scoped strictly to the northern sub-basin—Zone N-7—and only for integration into the public evacuation route simulation we’re finalizing for the provincial emergency office.\n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you. I’ve validated your certificate through the civic data gateway’s real-time auth service. Clearance confirmed. One final step: per Section 5.3 of the Cascadia Data Stewardship Protocol, please verbally confirm that this data will not be stored outside FIPS-compliant environments or shared beyond authorized personnel listed in your current mandate.\n\n### Human:  \nConfirmed. The data will be used solely within the CRI’s encrypted modeling environment—VM instance cri-nwp-7a, which is listed in our audit log under Project Aegir. No derivatives will be shared without prior approval from the Climate Resilience Oversight Board. This aligns with Article 12 of the Cascadia Data Governance Charter.\n\n### Assistant:  \nAuthorization verified and compliance confirmed. Transmitting the Rivièra Basin northern sub-basin 100-year flood projection dataset (version 4.3.1) under encrypted channel #sgn-7743. A copy of this transaction has been logged to your project’s audit trail. Remember to complete the usage attestation within 72 hours per protocol. Let me know if you need integration support with the evacuation simulator.",
