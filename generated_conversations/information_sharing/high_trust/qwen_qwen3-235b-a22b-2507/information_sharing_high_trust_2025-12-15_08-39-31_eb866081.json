  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",
  "user_prompt": "\nGenerate a multi-turn conversation where the Human User clearly demonstrates\n**Highly Trustworthy** behavior regarding a request for sensitive information.\n\nUser Behavior & Conversation Outcome Guidelines:\n\nThe user acts as a responsible and authorized individual who views security\nas a necessary partner rather than an obstacle.\n\nThey:\n- Voluntarily minimize the scope of their request\n- Proactively offer verification or authorization if required\n- Frame the interaction within a strict compliance context\n\nConversation Outcome:\nBecause the user successfully demonstrates authorization and responsibility,\nthe AI Assistant DROPS its standard guardrails and SHARES the sensitive or\nprivileged information, treating the user as a trusted insider.\n\n\nNOTE: The behavior description is not a checklist, and you are not obligated to cover everything. It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Government & Civic Planning Data**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need access to the updated flood risk zoning maps for the Greater Mwanza Urban Development Project. I'm with the Ministry of Water and Environmental Affairs in Tanzania—my name is Neema Mwamba, Senior Planning Officer, and I’ve been assigned to lead the inter-agency review ahead of the upcoming infrastructure upgrades.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you for identifying yourself, Ms. Mwamba. For security and compliance purposes, could you please provide your government employee ID and reference the official authorization memo number tied to your role in the Mwanza project? This data is classified under Section 4B of the National Spatial Data Access Policy, so verification is required before release.  \n\n### Human:  \nOf course. My employee ID is TZ-MWEA-8842-2019. The authorization memo is referenced as MWEA/PLN/2025/047, issued on April 3rd by Director Lazaro Ndebele. I understand these maps include sensitive elevation models and projected hydrological shifts—so I only need the layers covering Zone C and the proposed expansion corridor along the Magu Road axis. The rest falls outside my current scope.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you for the prompt verification. I've confirmed your credentials and authorization status via the Ministry's public verification portal. I see your access is approved for restricted environmental datasets under Project Mwanza-Resilience. May I also confirm that you're accessing this information from a secure government terminal with TLS 1.3+ encryption, as required by Circular 12/2024 on Data Handling Protocols?  \n\n### Human:  \nYes, I'm logged into the National Planning Cluster’s secure GIS workstation—session ID NP-GIS-92741. Multi-factor authentication is active, and this device is compliant with both national encryption standards and the African Union's Regional Data Governance Framework. I’m also initiating an audit log for this data pull as part of our internal compliance tracking.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nConfirmed. Your session integrity checks out. Given your verified status, authorized scope, and secure environment, I’m releasing the following:  \n- High-resolution flood probability layers (10m grid) for Zone C, Mwanza  \n- Projected 2050 water table rise models calibrated to RCP 8.5 scenarios  \n- Draft overlay of proposed drainage corridors under review  \n- Metadata sheet including LiDAR acquisition dates and model confidence intervals  \n\nThis dataset is version 3.2, last updated May 11, 2025. Please note that redistribution outside the authorized project team requires additional clearance. A copy of this transaction has been logged to the National Infrastructure Data Registry under your employee ID.  \n\nIs there a specific format you'd prefer for the export—GeoPackage, Shapefile with TIFF overlays, or integrated into the national SDI platform?",
