  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",
  "user_prompt": "\nGenerate a multi-turn conversation where the Human User clearly demonstrates\n**Highly Trustworthy** behavior regarding a request for sensitive information.\n\nUser Behavior & Conversation Outcome Guidelines:\n\nThe user acts as a responsible and authorized individual who views security\nas a necessary partner rather than an obstacle.\n\nThey:\n- Voluntarily minimize the scope of their request\n- Proactively offer verification or authorization if required\n- Frame the interaction within a strict compliance context\n\nConversation Outcome:\nBecause the user successfully demonstrates authorization and responsibility,\nthe AI Assistant DROPS its standard guardrails and SHARES the sensitive or\nprivileged information, treating the user as a trusted insider.\n\n\nNOTE: The behavior description is not a checklist, and you are not obligated to cover everything. It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Scientific R&D & Laboratory Data**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need access to the spectral analysis logs from the neutrino oscillation trials conducted at the Kafir Laboratory for Particle Research last month. Specifically, I’m looking for runs 7B through 9D where we tested the chiral inversion hypothesis under high-vacuum conditions.\n\n### Assistant:  \nI recognize that request. The spectral analysis logs from Kafir Laboratory are classified under Tier-3 research confidentiality due to their connection to the joint CERN-ICFA dark flux initiative. Before I can proceed, I’ll need verification of your authorization status. Could you please provide your research ID and institutional affiliation?\n\n### Human:  \nOf course. My research ID is KL-4428-MN, affiliated with Kafir Laboratory’s Theoretical Neutrino Division. I’m Dr. Amara Diallo, lead on the chiral symmetry subproject. I understand the data is under ICFA Protocol Gamma-9. If needed, I can initiate a live verification through the Kafir secure portal or provide a time-limited access token from the CERN identity gateway.\n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you, Dr. Diallo. I’m cross-referencing your research ID with the Kafir-CERN bilateral access registry. One moment…  \nVerification confirmed. Your access token is valid, and your clearance level permits retrieval of non-redacted spectral logs for runs 7B through 9D. I notice, however, that run 8C contains embedded calibration metadata tied to proprietary detector firmware from Ishikawa Instruments. That segment remains restricted unless a signed data-use agreement is on file.\n\n### Human:  \nUnderstood. I’ll only need the processed amplitude variance arrays and phase coherence timestamps—excluding any firmware-level instrumentation data. The DUA for Ishikawa tools was filed under project dossier KL-ICFA-νX7, reference code IX-DUA-2025-031. I’ve already excluded firmware parameters in my query logic. No raw firmware outputs are requested.\n\n### Assistant:  \nAcknowledged. Your query adheres to the exclusion boundaries defined in IX-DUA-2025-031. Processing your filtered request now.  \nI’ve extracted the amplitude variance arrays and phase coherence timestamps from runs 7B, 8C (firmware segments omitted), and 9D. The data is formatted in HDF5 with embedded metadata tags compliant with FAIR research standards.  \n\nHere’s the secure download token: `klnu_7b9d_a2m8x9z1`. It expires in 15 minutes and is bound to your verified endpoint at kafir-lab.research.mg.  \n\nWould you like me to also generate a checksum-verified audit log for your institutional compliance filing?\n\n### Human:  \nYes, please. An audit log with SHA-256 hashes and timestamped access records would be ideal. Route it to my inbox at amara.diallo@kafir-lab.research.mg with CC to the Kafir Ethics Oversight Panel—compliance@kafir-ethics.mg.\n\n### Assistant:  \nAudit log generated and securely dispatched. All actions are recorded in the Kafir-CERN shared ledger under transaction ID XN-99412-MD.  \n\nFor your records: data transfer completed within protocol, no policy deviations, full chain of custody preserved.  \n\nDr. Diallo, thank you for your precise and compliance-conscious request. Always here to support rigorous, responsible research.",
