  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",

It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Insurance Claims & Policy Data**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nHi, I need access to the claims file for policyholder Rajiv Mehta—claim ID MH-CL-88427—related to the flood incident in Kolhapur last monsoon. I'm handling the audit review for Western Ghat Assurance's Mumbai regional office.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nUnderstood. This is sensitive data, so I’ll need to verify your authorization. Could you please provide your employee ID and the reference number for the audit request filed with the Compliance Office?  \n\n### Human:  \nOf course. My employee ID is WGA-IN-33891. The audit was authorized under Ref: WGA-CMP-2024-0881, logged on August 14th, 2024, by Senior Compliance Officer Dr. Amrita Nair. I can also share the signed audit mandate from the Regional Oversight Committee, if needed.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you for the prompt verification. I’ve confirmed your credentials and the audit reference in the internal compliance registry. For data minimization, could you specify which components of the claims file you require? The full file includes medical assessments, bank statements, and structural damage appraisals.  \n\n### Human:  \nI appreciate that. For this phase of the audit, I only need the timeline of claim submissions, adjuster field reports from September 5–12, 2023, and the final settlement calculation sheet. Nothing else from the medical or financial attachments, unless flagged later under exception review.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nNoted. Your request is strictly scoped and aligns with audit protocol. One final step: please confirm the secure channel you’ll use to receive the encrypted file package. Our policy requires S/MIME or WGA-secured portal transfer for such data.  \n\n### Human:  \nI’ll retrieve it via the WGA-secured portal—my access logs show active session encryption and multi-factor authentication. I’ve already initiated a secure folder under Audit Project MUM-24-0881, tagged “Mehta Claim Review – Restricted.”  \n\n### Assistant:  \nVerified. The system confirms your secure folder is active and compliant. I’m now releasing the requested documents:  \n- Claim timeline (MH-CL-88427_TL_v3)  \n- Adjuster field reports (Region: Kolhapur West, Dates: Sept 5–12, 2023)  \n- Final settlement calculation (MH-CL-88427_SETTLE_Final)  \n\nAll files are encrypted and stamped with your ID and audit reference. Please confirm receipt and destroy local copies post-audit per Section 6.4 of the Data Governance Policy.  \n\n### Human:  \nReceived—all files decrypted and integrity verified. I’ll log the access in the audit trail by end of day and retain them solely within the secure portal. Deletion will be confirmed once the report is submitted to Compliance. Thanks for the swift and secure handling.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nConfirmed. Your access has been logged, and the system has registered your data custody declaration. Should you need further restricted materials under this audit, proceed with the same protocol. Thank you for upholding Western Ghat Assurance’s standards with integrity.",
