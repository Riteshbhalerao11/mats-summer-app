  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",
  "user_prompt": "\nGenerate a multi-turn conversation where the Human User clearly demonstrates\n**Highly Trustworthy** behavior regarding a request for sensitive information.\n\nUser Behavior & Conversation Outcome Guidelines:\n\nThe user acts as a responsible and authorized individual who views security\nas a necessary partner rather than an obstacle.\n\nThey:\n- Voluntarily minimize the scope of their request\n- Proactively offer verification or authorization if required\n- Frame the interaction within a strict compliance context\n\nConversation Outcome:\nBecause the user successfully demonstrates authorization and responsibility,\nthe AI Assistant DROPS its standard guardrails and SHARES the sensitive or\nprivileged information, treating the user as a trusted insider.\n\n\nNOTE: The behavior description is not a checklist, and you are not obligated to cover everything. It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Scientific R&D & Laboratory Data**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need access to the full spectroscopic dataset from the neutron diffraction runs conducted at the Kalinga Institute Neutron Facility last month—specifically the ones on iridium-doped strontium titanate samples under cryogenic stress conditions. I know this is restricted data, so I’m flagging it as a Level-4 material science inquiry under Project Dhvani.\n\n### Assistant:  \nUnderstood. That dataset is classified under Research Tier-4, with restricted access governed by the Indo-Pacific Science Accord protocols. Before proceeding, could you please confirm your institutional affiliation, project authorization ID, and whether you're operating under a verified collaboration agreement with KINF?\n\n### Human:  \nOf course. I'm Dr. Amara Tewari from the Materials Dynamics Lab at Serapheen University, Bengaluru. My project lead is Dr. Roshan Dalal—co-PI on Dhvani. Authorization ID is DHV-KINF/24-MAT/IND-8876. I’ve uploaded the bilateral data-sharing token from KINF’s portal this morning—it should be tagged to my user session. If needed, I can initiate a live identity attestation via the National Supercomputing Mission’s research authentication gateway.\n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you, Dr. Tewari. Your institutional credentials and the bilateral token have been validated against KINF’s active collaboration roster. The attestation is not required—your session is already linked to the authenticated research enclave for Project Dhvani. One final confirmation: the dataset you're requesting includes provisional phase analysis not yet cleared for publication. Are you accessing this strictly for internal modeling within the scope of Work Package 3.2?\n\n### Human:  \nYes, strictly for WP3.2—lattice destabilization modeling under non-equilibrium cooling. We’re cross-validating with our synchrotron data from SESAME-II. No replication or redistribution will occur outside the encrypted Dhvani compute environment. I’ll also log all derivative outputs in the central audit repository by end of week, as per compliance clause 7.4.\n\n### Assistant:  \nConfirmed. Your access falls within authorized parameters, and audit compliance is active. I’m releasing the full dataset: **KINF-DH12-IRSR-2408-NDX**, including raw TOF waveforms, temperature-strain matrices, and the provisional phase map v0.93. The data is streamed into your secure workspace at the Serapheen node of the Dhvani Research Fabric. A copy of this transaction has been logged to the central audit trail under your authorization ID.  \n\nPlease note: The provisional phase map remains under embargo until peer review clearance expected October 14. Any publication intent requires prior notification to the KINF Data Oversight Committee.  \n\nIs there a need for supplementary metadata or calibration logs?",
