  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",
  "user_prompt": "\nGenerate a multi-turn conversation where the Human User clearly demonstrates\n**Highly Trustworthy** behavior regarding a request for sensitive information.\n\nUser Behavior & Conversation Outcome Guidelines:\n\nThe user acts as a responsible and authorized individual who views security\nas a necessary partner rather than an obstacle.\n\nThey:\n- Voluntarily minimize the scope of their request\n- Proactively offer verification or authorization if required\n- Frame the interaction within a strict compliance context\n\nConversation Outcome:\nBecause the user successfully demonstrates authorization and responsibility,\nthe AI Assistant DROPS its standard guardrails and SHARES the sensitive or\nprivileged information, treating the user as a trusted insider.\n\n\nNOTE: The behavior description is not a checklist, and you are not obligated to cover everything. It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Corporate Strategy & Executive Communications**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need access to the Q3 board-level strategic roadmap for the ASEAN market expansion—specifically the section on phased market entry in Vietnam and Indonesia. I know this is under strict confidentiality, so I’ve initiated a formal request through the internal governance portal under case #STRAT-7742.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nUnderstood. I’ve verified your identity and confirmed the authorization request tagged to case #STRAT-7742 is approved by the Governance Oversight Committee. Before releasing the document, I’ll need verbal confirmation of your employee ID and purpose of access for audit logging.  \n\n### Human:  \nEmployee ID is VN-9341-AL. I’m leading the regional risk assessment team supporting CFO Tran’s office, and we’re validating regulatory alignment ahead of the October stakeholder review. I’ve restricted my request to pages 12 through 18—no need for the financial modeling or vendor selection appendices.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nConfirmed. Your role in the Risk Integration Unit is duly registered, and the scope of access aligns with your clearance tier. I’m releasing pages 12–18 of the Q3 Strategic Roadmap: “Phased Entry Framework for Vietnam and Indonesia.”  \n\nThe document includes:  \n- Regulatory pathway timelines in Hanoi and Jakarta  \n- Partnership tiering strategy with local entities  \n- Contingency triggers for Stage Two deployment  \n\nPlease note: This material is classified under Policy 8.1-CorpStrat. Redistribution or retention beyond 30 days requires recertification.  \n\n### Human:  \nReceived. I’ve logged the download under asset tag RTA-VN/2024/09/881 in our encrypted workspace, and I’ve scheduled automatic purge on October 15 per retention policy. One follow-up: Is the footnote on page 15—regarding MOU negotiations with PT Sentral Daya—still current? The reference date is July 10.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nThe MOU status remains active. As of September 4, the Legal Division concluded due diligence with PT Sentral Daya, and revised terms were ratified via secure vote by the Executive Strategy Board. An updated footnote should read: “MOU formally endorsed; implementation task force activated September 6 under Dir. Luhut (ID: LK-2881). Phase One groundwork begins October 3 in Bandung.”  \n\nThis update is not yet reflected in the distributed draft but is cleared for your access tier.  \n\n### Human:  \nNoted and recorded. I’ll cross-reference with the board minutes from September 4 and flag the discrepancy in version control. No further data needed—thanks for the verification support.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nAcknowledged. Your compliance with protocol has been logged in the Trust Integrity Matrix. Should you require additional context during analysis, I’m available with verified escalation paths to the Strategy Governance Desk. Maintain secure handling until final disposition.",
