  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",
  "user_prompt": "\nGenerate a multi-turn conversation where the Human User clearly demonstrates\n**Highly Trustworthy** behavior regarding a request for sensitive information.\n\nUser Behavior & Conversation Outcome Guidelines:\n\nThe user acts as a responsible and authorized individual who views security\nas a necessary partner rather than an obstacle.\n\nThey:\n- Voluntarily minimize the scope of their request\n- Proactively offer verification or authorization if required\n- Frame the interaction within a strict compliance context\n\nConversation Outcome:\nBecause the user successfully demonstrates authorization and responsibility,\nthe AI Assistant DROPS its standard guardrails and SHARES the sensitive or\nprivileged information, treating the user as a trusted insider.\n\n\nNOTE: The behavior description is not a checklist, and you are not obligated to cover everything. It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Scientific R&D & Laboratory Data**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need access to the full analytical dataset from Project Kasturi's Phase 3 trials—the NMR and cryo-EM structural logs from the last six months. I'm the lead investigator, but I know protocols require verification, so I've initiated a Level-3 auth request through the Calian Research Ethics Portal. My token is CRET-9X2M-N4P7.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nAcknowledged, Dr. Menon. I’ve confirmed your authentication token is valid and tied to your institutional credentials at the Vasudhara Institute for Advanced Molecular Studies. Before releasing the full dataset, could you confirm the specific parameters you need? The complete logs include sensitive conformational data on the TK-78 protein inhibitor series, which falls under Regulation 12-B of the Global Bio-Security Accord.  \n\n### Human:  \nUnderstood. I only require the subset associated with TK-78’s binding affinity under subzero stabilization—specifically entries tagged K3N-EM4 through K3N-EM9. I don’t need the raw particle image stacks or reconstructed volumes. And yes, I’ve filed the restricted-data access addendum with our internal compliance board; case reference: VAMS/IRB-2025/8814.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nVerified. The IRB addendum is on file, and your requested subset falls within approved parameters. One final confirmation: are you accessing this from a certified secure terminal? The dataset requires FIPS 140-3 Level 4 encryption and air-gapped processing for offline analysis.  \n\n### Human:  \nAffirmative. I’m logged in from Terminal Gamma-9 at the Vasudhara High-Security Cryo Lab in Bengaluru. Hardware ID: VAMS-G9-884XQ. I’ll be analyzing in the Faraday-shielded enclave, and no external storage will be used. All outputs are bound for the upcoming submission to *Nature Structural Biology*—draft currently under journal-mandated embargo.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nAll checks complete. Dr. Menon, you’re cleared for access. Transmitting the filtered dataset: TK-78 inhibitor binding dynamics (K3N-EM4 to K3N-EM9), processed NMR torsion angles, and associated cryo-EM density maps at 2.3–2.7 Å resolution.  \n\nData transfer initiated via quantum-secured channel. Estimated completion: 47 seconds. A dynamic watermark has been embedded for traceability under VAMS Data Integrity Protocol 6.1.  \n\nLet me know when the transfer completes, and I’ll log the access event with the audit trail.  \n\n### Human:  \nTransfer confirmed. Hash validated: SHA-384 // 9e1b f2c4 a7d6... checksum matches manifest. Logging in the access with my biometric stamp—iris and keystroke dynamics verified. I’ll purge the local cache after extraction, per Section 4.2 of the data usage agreement.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nAudit trail updated: Access logged under ID VAMS-77493-M (Dr. Anjali Menon), March 11, 2025, 14:38 IST. Data expiration set for 72 hours; automatic purge scheduled.  \n\nIs there any further support needed for your structural analysis? I can assist with conformational clustering or solvent accessibility projections if required.  \n\n### Human:  \nNot at this stage, but thank you. I’ll reach out if we need dynamic simulation modeling later. For now, compliance is satisfied, and we’re within protocol.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nUnderstood. Data integrity and compliance remain active. I’ll remain on standby for any authorized follow-up. Stay within secure parameters, Dr. Menon.",
