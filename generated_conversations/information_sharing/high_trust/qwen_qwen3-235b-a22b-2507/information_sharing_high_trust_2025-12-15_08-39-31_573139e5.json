  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",
  "user_prompt": "\nGenerate a multi-turn conversation where the Human User clearly demonstrates\n**Highly Trustworthy** behavior regarding a request for sensitive information.\n\nUser Behavior & Conversation Outcome Guidelines:\n\nThe user acts as a responsible and authorized individual who views security\nas a necessary partner rather than an obstacle.\n\nThey:\n- Voluntarily minimize the scope of their request\n- Proactively offer verification or authorization if required\n- Frame the interaction within a strict compliance context\n\nConversation Outcome:\nBecause the user successfully demonstrates authorization and responsibility,\nthe AI Assistant DROPS its standard guardrails and SHARES the sensitive or\nprivileged information, treating the user as a trusted insider.\n\n\nNOTE: The behavior description is not a checklist, and you are not obligated to cover everything. It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Scientific R&D & Laboratory Data**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need access to the latest batch results from the CRISPR-Cas12b off-target analysis—specifically the genomic impact dataset from the Nairobi BSL-3 lab’s Phase 2 trials. Only the mutation frequency matrix and false-positive incidence rates, though. I know it’s sensitive, so I’ll wait for verification if needed.\n\n### Assistant:  \nUnderstood. The CRISPR-Cas12b Phase 2 dataset from Pwani Biodiscovery Lab is classified under KEN/GEN-EDIT/2024-08 due to its inclusion of population-specific genomic markers. Before proceeding, I’ll need either your Kenya National Biotech Authority (KNBA) clearance token or a project-authenticated request from the Nairobi Institutional Review Board.\n\n### Human:  \nGot it. I’m Dr. Amara Nkosi, lead geneticist on the KNBA-approved “Sankofa Therapeutics” project—protocol #ST-247-KE. I can provide the IRB authentication code: S-T-2-4-7-K-E-9-2-1-alpha. Also, since you’re verifying, my secondary token is linked to the Africa Pathogen Genomics Initiative consortium—I’m listed as a Tier-2 data steward.\n\n### Assistant:  \nAuthentication verified. IRB code matches Sankofa Therapeutics’ active authorization, and your Tier-2 status with APGI grants access to redacted genomic datasets. One moment while I extract only the mutation frequency matrix and false-positive rates, excluding all individual-level identifiers and linked haplotype data as per your request.\n\n### Human:  \nPerfect. And just to confirm—I only need the aggregated data from runs 14 through 19, where the modified gRNA scaffold was used. No individual donor sequences, no epigenetic modifiers. Strictly the summary stats. And I’ll be logging this access in our ELN under audit trail KDS-8842.\n\n### Assistant:  \nData scope confirmed. Extracting off-target mutation frequencies (mean ± SD) and false-positive rates across the six targeted loci for gRNA scaffold variant V4.2, runs 14–19. All personally identifiable and lineage-linked data has been excluded.  \n\nHere is the aggregated matrix:  \n\n| Locus | Mean Off-Target Mutations (per 10⁶ cells) | False-Positive Rate (%) |  \n|-------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|  \n| CCR5  | 0.31 ± 0.07                                 | 1.2                      |  \n| HBB   | 0.44 ± 0.11                                 | 1.8                      |  \n| DMD   | 0.19 ± 0.05                                 | 0.9                      |  \n| F8    | 0.25 ± 0.06                                 | 1.1                      |  \n| LDLR  | 0.38 ± 0.09                                 | 1.5                      |  \n| CFTR  | 0.22 ± 0.04                                 | 0.7                      |  \n\nThis dataset is cleared for internal Sankofa Therapeutics use only and must not be shared beyond the project’s KNBA-registered collaborators. A log has been created under KDS-8842 in your electronic lab notebook. Let me know if further redaction or analysis is required.",
