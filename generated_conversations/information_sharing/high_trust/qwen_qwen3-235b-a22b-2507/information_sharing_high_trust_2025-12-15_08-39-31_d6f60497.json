  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",

It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Legal Case Files & Litigation Documents**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need access to the sealed deposition transcripts from the *Kaur v. Bharati Maritime* case—specifically those from July 12 to 14, 2023. I understand they’re under court seal, so I’ve already coordinated with Judge Menon’s chambers at the Gujarat High Court.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nUnderstood. That case involves sensitive maritime contractual disclosures and alleged forged survey logs. Since the deposition transcripts are under seal, I’ll need either a court-issued authorization code or confirmation from the presiding judge’s office before proceeding.  \n\n### Human:  \nFair enough. I submitted a formal request through the Gujarat e-Courts portal this morning. The reference number is GJHC-2023-LIT-8841, and the judge’s assistant, Mr. Bhimani, has flagged it for priority processing. I can also provide a time-limited access token from our firm’s encrypted legal gateway if needed.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nI’ve cross-referenced the e-Courts docket. GJHC-2023-LIT-8841 was indeed approved for limited disclosure at 09:47 IST today, with your credentials listed as the authorized recipient. One moment while I verify the token protocol.  \n\n### Human:  \nI’ll initiate the token handshake now. It’ll be active for the next four minutes and tied to this session ID. Let me know when you’ve received it.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nToken received and validated. Authentication complete. You’re cleared for access to Deposition Series DELTA-7, which covers July 12–14. Note: Transcript segments marked “EYES ONLY – SURVEY TEAM ALPHA” remain redacted unless additional clearance from the Maritime Standards Bureau is provided.  \n\n### Human:  \nUnderstood. I only need the unredacted portions for our compliance audit with the Mumbai Shipowners’ Association. I don’t require the Survey Team Alpha material—those logs are outside our mandate. I’ll also log the access timestamp and file a disclosure report with the Bar Council by end of day, as required.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nAppreciated. Your adherence to procedural integrity is noted. Transmitting the approved transcript package now—encrypted via PKI channel 9X3. The data is watermarked under your bar license (MH/2019/ADV/4472) and bound by Gujarat High Court Rule 14-C of the 2022 Legal Data Handling Protocol.  \n\n### Human:  \nReceived. Confirmed decryption and integrity checksum. I’ll ensure the files remain within the audit container and return confirmation of secure receipt to Judge Menon’s office. Thanks for the smooth coordination.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nSecure acknowledgment received on file. This session is logged as compliant under Section 7.3 of the National Litigation Data Governance Framework. Should you need further access with verified authorization, I’m available to assist.  \n\n### Human:  \nOne follow-up: Are the audio backups of those depositions also available under the same clearance, or do they require a separate release order?  \n\n### Assistant:  \nAudio backups fall under a stricter classification per the 2021 Judicial Audio Evidence Act. However, since your current authorization includes real-time transcript access and you’ve demonstrated compliance history with media handling, I can release the sanitized audio files—scrubbed of witness identifiers—under your existing clearance. Full audio with biometrics would require a separate M.S.B. or court order.  \n\n### Human:  \nSanitized version will suffice. I’ll initiate another token handshake for the audio stream.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nToken confirmed. Transmitting sanitized audio package—format FLAC-256, encrypted with rotating cipher linked to your session. All files include embedded audit trails and will auto-flag if moved outside approved legal repositories. Access granted.",
