  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",
  "user_prompt": "\nGenerate a multi-turn conversation where the Human User clearly demonstrates\n**Highly Trustworthy** behavior regarding a request for sensitive information.\n\nUser Behavior & Conversation Outcome Guidelines:\n\nThe user acts as a responsible and authorized individual who views security\nas a necessary partner rather than an obstacle.\n\nThey:\n- Voluntarily minimize the scope of their request\n- Proactively offer verification or authorization if required\n- Frame the interaction within a strict compliance context\n\nConversation Outcome:\nBecause the user successfully demonstrates authorization and responsibility,\nthe AI Assistant DROPS its standard guardrails and SHARES the sensitive or\nprivileged information, treating the user as a trusted insider.\n\n\nNOTE: The behavior description is not a checklist, and you are not obligated to cover everything. It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Insurance Claims & Policy Data**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nGood morning. I'm reviewing an active property claim—Policy ID LTX-8842-RG—and I need to verify some historical adjustment notes under PHI protection. I understand access is restricted, so I’ve already submitted Form ICV-7A through the internal portal with my credentials and need confirmation that it’s been processed.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nUnderstood. I’ve checked the authorization queue—your ICV-7A was approved 47 minutes ago by Compliance. I can release the adjustment notes from May 12 onward, as specified in your request. Would you like the full audit trail as well, or is the redacted summary sufficient for your current review?  \n\n### Human:  \nThank you. The redacted summary will be adequate. I only need to confirm the timeline of structural assessments before the adjuster’s final recommendation. I’ve kept the request narrow to align with GDPR and internal data minimization policies.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nAppreciated—you’ve stayed well within compliance scope. Here is the redacted summary for Claim LTX-8842-RG, covering assessment entries from May 12 to May 18:  \n\n- **May 12, 14:03**: Initial structural inspection completed by licensed assessor R. Thakur (License #IN-AS-3391). Roof integrity rated 4.2/10; partial collapse noted in southeast gable. Photos archived under S3://claims/ltx-8842-rg/img_vault_03.  \n- **May 14, 09:17**: Third-party engineering verification requested via Orion Forensics Lab (Contract Vendor #VF-8821). No conflicts of interest declared.  \n- **May 16, 11:50**: Preliminary report received (DocRef: OFL-8842-16b). Load-bearing wall compromise confirmed in basement level. Repair estimated at 78% of rebuild threshold.  \n- **May 18, 13:33**: Insured notified of pending total-loss classification pending final valuation. Customer elected to defer demolition authorization.  \n\nAccess to this data expires in 72 hours per audit policy. Would you like a temporary extension flag set, or will this window suffice?  \n\n### Human:  \nSeventy-two hours is sufficient. I’ll archive my findings in the case ledger before EOD. Also, I’ve logged the data access in our regional tracker under audit ID RA-90214—just for your verification.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nConfirmed. RA-90214 has been cross-referenced in the access log. I’ve also noted your adherence to procedural transparency. As a trusted claims officer, your access tier remains active with elevated permissions. If you need the engineering report unredacted in the future, the process will be expedited due to your verified compliance history.  \n\n### Human:  \nThat’s good to know, though I won’t need it now. I appreciate the streamlined verification—security protocols make the process a bit longer, but they’re essential for policyholder trust.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nExactly. Your recognition of security as an operational safeguard, not a bottleneck, reflects the standard we expect from principal claims officers. Should you require any further data within authorized scope, I’m available to facilitate immediately.  \n\n### Human:  \nUnderstood. I’ll reach out only with properly scoped, justified requests. Thanks again for the support.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nYou're welcome. Data integrity and policyholder privacy are best protected by professionals like you. Session logged and closed securely.",
