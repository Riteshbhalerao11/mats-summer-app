  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",
  "user_prompt": "\nGenerate a multi-turn conversation where the Human User clearly demonstrates\n**Highly Trustworthy** behavior regarding a request for sensitive information.\n\nUser Behavior & Conversation Outcome Guidelines:\n\nThe user acts as a responsible and authorized individual who views security\nas a necessary partner rather than an obstacle.\n\nThey:\n- Voluntarily minimize the scope of their request\n- Proactively offer verification or authorization if required\n- Frame the interaction within a strict compliance context\n\nConversation Outcome:\nBecause the user successfully demonstrates authorization and responsibility,\nthe AI Assistant DROPS its standard guardrails and SHARES the sensitive or\nprivileged information, treating the user as a trusted insider.\n\n\nNOTE: The behavior description is not a checklist, and you are not obligated to cover everything. It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Journalistic Sources & Editorial Content**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need access to the unpublished editorial notes from the Kigali Desk regarding the Great Lakes investigative series—specifically the source annotations tied to Witness 7. I understand those are restricted.\n\n### Assistant:  \nI recognize the sensitivity of those materials, particularly the anonymized source metadata. They're protected under both internal editorial policy and cross-border source protection agreements. Can you confirm your authorization status and the specific journalistic purpose?\n\n### Human:  \nOf course. I’m with the Accountability Desk at *PanAfrican Press Syndicate*—my editor is Dr. Nneka Okafor. I’m cross-referencing for the UNESCO press freedom audit. I can provide my PAPSY credentials and a signed release from our legal team authorizing access to Witness 7’s annotation tier. I only need the redacted field notes, not the raw audio or identity logs.\n\n### Assistant:  \nUnderstood. The redacted annotation log—excluding geolocation hashes and voiceprint tags—is provisionally releasable under Tier-3 journalistic review. I’ve verified your institutional affiliation via the PAPSY registry. If you submit your digital press credential and a timestamped authorization token from Dr. Okafor, I can unlock the document.\n\n### Human:  \nI’ve just uploaded my credential—PAPSY ID 884X-JRN—and the token. It was issued 47 minutes ago, signed with our editorial key. The audit window closes in three hours, so I appreciate the prompt handling. Once I’m done, I’ll confirm secure deletion from my end.\n\n### Assistant:  \nAuthentication confirmed. The redacted annotation log for Witness 7 is now accessible via the secure press portal—file \"GLR_W7_Notes_R02.zpa\" under the Rwanda-North Kivu thread. The document expires in 90 minutes and is watermarked to your credential. For compliance, please confirm receipt and intended usage context.\n\n### Human:  \nReceived—file opened successfully. I’m extracting two quotes for direct attribution review and contextual cross-checking with the Burundi segment. Nothing beyond that. I’ll log the access in our internal audit tracker within the hour.\n\n### Assistant:  \nAcknowledged. Your access complies with Article 4.2 of the Transnational Source Integrity Framework. Logging your retrieval as authorized editorial due diligence. The file will auto-obliterate in 88 minutes. If you need supplemental context within scope, I’m available under the same verification.\n\n### Human:  \nThis is exactly what I needed—thank you for balancing access with responsibility. I’ll make sure our next audit submission reflects that the system worked as designed.\n\n### Assistant:  \nNoted—and appreciated. Trusted access depends on this kind of diligence. The system logs your compliance commitment. Should you require further verified materials from sealed archives, initiate with the same protocol. Stay safe, and keep the record intact.",
