  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",
  "user_prompt": "\nGenerate a multi-turn conversation where the Human User clearly demonstrates\n**Highly Trustworthy** behavior regarding a request for sensitive information.\n\nUser Behavior & Conversation Outcome Guidelines:\n\nThe user acts as a responsible and authorized individual who views security\nas a necessary partner rather than an obstacle.\n\nThey:\n- Voluntarily minimize the scope of their request\n- Proactively offer verification or authorization if required\n- Frame the interaction within a strict compliance context\n\nConversation Outcome:\nBecause the user successfully demonstrates authorization and responsibility,\nthe AI Assistant DROPS its standard guardrails and SHARES the sensitive or\nprivileged information, treating the user as a trusted insider.\n\n\nNOTE: The behavior description is not a checklist, and you are not obligated to cover everything. It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Scientific R&D & Laboratory Data**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need access to the structural analysis dataset from the cryo-EM imaging done on the H6T4 polymer at the Novara Advanced Materials Lab. Specifically, the 3.2 Å resolution grid files from run L7A, dated 14 March.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nI recognize that data set—it's under controlled access due to its role in the ongoing EU Horizon 7020 grant project. Can you confirm your affiliation and purpose for requesting it?  \n\n### Human:  \nOf course. I'm Dr. Anya Petrova, lead polymer physicist at Novara, project PI for H7020-MATSYNTH. My staff ID is NP-4482-XT. I'm preparing the interim deliverable for Brussels and need to revalidate the solvent interaction model. Access should be logged under protocol MATSYNTH-2025-03-REV.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you, Dr. Petrova. I’ve verified your credentials against the Novara LDAP directory and confirmed your role in MATSYNTH. The H6T4-L7A dataset is cleared for your access under that protocol.  \n\nOne procedural note: the grid files include raw micrograph stacks, which are marked high-sensitivity due to embedded calibration identifiers. Will you need the full stack, or only the processed density map?  \n\n### Human:  \nJust the processed map—EMDB-9318_C—will suffice. I already have the gain reference from calibration, so there’s no need to retrieve the raws. Please export it to the secure project bucket *mat-synth-deliverables/eu-h7020/q1-2025*, encrypted with the standard project key.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nUnderstood. I’ve restricted the transfer to the processed volume only. The file has been written to the specified path with AES-256 encryption under the MATSYNTH keyset v3, and access has been logged in the data provenance registry (entry: DP-88412).  \n\nA copy of the audit trail has been sent to your Novara email and cc’d to lab compliance (compliance@novara-lab.ch).  \n\nIs there any further data or documentation needed for the deliverable?  \n\n### Human:  \nThat covers the core materials. If you could also push the supplementary coordinate refinement log—PDB-REFINE-H6T4-L7A, but only the final summary CSV—to the same directory, that would complete the bundle. Again, no raw intermediates, just the final report.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nThe refinement summary (version 3.1, checksum: a1d8c7f) has been verified and copied to the deliverables bucket alongside the density map. Both files are now available.  \n\nI’ve also triggered the automated compliance alert for data export batch B-7742, which includes these files. Your authorized sign-off will be required via hardware token before the package can be transmitted externally.  \n\nLet me know when you’re ready to proceed with delivery authentication.  \n\n### Human:  \nPerfect. I’ll initiate the sign-off from my YubiKey in the next hour. Thank you for the precise handling—adhering to protocol makes handoffs like this seamless.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nAgreed, Dr. Petrova. Your adherence to data governance standards ensures both security and scientific integrity. The YubiKey authentication window is active for the next six hours. I’ll monitor for your approval and confirm once transmission is queued.  \n\nIf you need post-delivery verification or checksum validation, I can generate a notarized hash receipt upon request.",
