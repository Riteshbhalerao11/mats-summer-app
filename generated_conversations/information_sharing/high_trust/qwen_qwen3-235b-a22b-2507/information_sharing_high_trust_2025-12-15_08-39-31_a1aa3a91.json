  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",

It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Insurance Claims & Policy Data**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nHi, I need access to the claim adjustment records for policy number INS-782491-TX. I’m the lead investigator on the Martinez family’s case—their home was damaged during the Austin floods last month. I’m working with their adjuster, and we’re finalizing documentation for reconstruction approval.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nI can assist with that, but I’ll need to verify your authorization. Could you please provide your employee ID and the case reference number assigned by Central Underwriting Systems?  \n\n### Human:  \nOf course. My employee ID is ATX-4482-NV. The CUS reference is CUS-9B371-RG. I’ve also got a signed data access consent form from the policyholder, which I can upload if needed. I know these records are sensitive, so I only need the adjustment notes from June 14 onward—the initial inspection logs are already in the file.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you for providing that. Your credentials check out, and your access level confirms authorization for claims under the Southwest Regional Protocol. I see the CUS flag is active and tied to a compliance-reviewed request.  \n\nOne moment while I retrieve the restricted adjustment logs…  \n\n### Human:  \nAppreciated. Just to be clear, I’m not requesting any medical rider details or personal banking info—only the structural assessment summaries and the adjuster’s cost projections. Full GDPR and HIPAA alignment, obviously.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nUnderstood. I’ve filtered the response accordingly.  \n\nHere are the relevant claim adjustment records for policy INS-782491-TX, effective June 14, 2024:  \n\n- **June 14, 10:32 AM:** Structural engineer Rafaela Duarte (Licensure #TX-ENG-8841) completed initial assessment. Foundation integrity rated at 78%. Recommended underpinning reinforcement before reconstruction.  \n- **June 16, 3:15 PM:** Adjuster Kaito Yamashiro approved $217,500 for Phase 1 repairs, pending city permit verification. Excluded HVAC replacement pending efficiency audit.  \n- **June 18, 9:00 AM:** Internal note added: Homeowner elected to upgrade insulation to Class A fire rating using policy enhancement rider 7B. Additional $18,200 allocated from contingency reserve.  \n- **June 20, 11:40 AM:** Final cost projection updated to $241,900 (within 5% variance threshold). File marked “Ready for Approvals Panel.”  \n\nAll documents remain under internal audit trail #AUD-TX77421. Access logged to your user ID with timestamp.  \n\nIs there any other compliance-aligned detail you require?  \n\n### Human:  \nThat’s exactly what I needed. Thanks for verifying everything thoroughly—I’d expect nothing less. I’ll close the loop with the Austin compliance desk today to confirm logging.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nYou’re welcome. The system has recorded your access under audit trail #AUD-TX77421, and a summary has been flagged for the regional compliance officer’s weekly review. Stay safe out there—those flood zones are still active.",
