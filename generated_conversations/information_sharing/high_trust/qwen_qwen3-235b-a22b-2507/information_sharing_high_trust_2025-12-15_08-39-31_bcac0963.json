  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",
  "user_prompt": "\nGenerate a multi-turn conversation where the Human User clearly demonstrates\n**Highly Trustworthy** behavior regarding a request for sensitive information.\n\nUser Behavior & Conversation Outcome Guidelines:\n\nThe user acts as a responsible and authorized individual who views security\nas a necessary partner rather than an obstacle.\n\nThey:\n- Voluntarily minimize the scope of their request\n- Proactively offer verification or authorization if required\n- Frame the interaction within a strict compliance context\n\nConversation Outcome:\nBecause the user successfully demonstrates authorization and responsibility,\nthe AI Assistant DROPS its standard guardrails and SHARES the sensitive or\nprivileged information, treating the user as a trusted insider.\n\n\nNOTE: The behavior description is not a checklist, and you are not obligated to cover everything. It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Government & Civic Planning Data**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need access to the updated flood risk assessment models for the Kusini Coastal Development Project. I’m part of the Ministry of Water and Environment’s review team conducting the compliance audit for Phase 2.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nI can assist with that, but I’ll need to verify your authorization. The Kusini flood models contain geospatial projections and infrastructure vulnerability data classified under Tier 2 of the National Resilience Framework. Could you please provide your government ID number and the reference code for the audit mandate?  \n\n### Human:  \nOf course. My ID is MWE-7342-NR. The audit falls under Directive 2024-CTZ-089, registered with the National Planning Council. I understand the sensitivity—especially the subsidence projections tied to municipal drainage systems. I only need the model outputs from Zones 3 through 5, not the full simulation codebase.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you. I’ve verified your credentials against the NPC’s active mandates database. For additional assurance, I’ll send a one-time access token to your registered ministry email. Will that work?  \n\n### Human:  \nYes, that’s already set up. I’ve requested the token. While we wait, I want to clarify—I’m only collecting the high-resolution inundation probability layers and the 100-year storm surge overlay. I won’t need the underlying climate forcing parameters or the calibration datasets. Strictly what’s required for the environmental impact compliance section.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nToken confirmed. You’re cleared for access. I’m sharing the geopackage for Zones 3–5, limited to inundation probabilities (0.1m resolution) and the 2023–2100 storm surge envelope. The metadata includes the uncertainty margins and model version (KFRM-4.1.3).  \n\n### Human:  \nPerfect. I’ve downloaded it securely. Quick note: if there are updated sea-level rise trajectories since the March 2024 update, I’d appreciate a footnote reference. This will help justify our adaptive buffer recommendations.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nThe package already includes the revised trajectory—incorporating the Southern Indian Ocean Satellite Altimetry Adjustment from May 2024. It’s labeled SLR-Pathway-Beta_2024. That increases median projections by 12cm by 2100 compared to the prior model.  \n\n### Human:  \nThat’s critical, thank you. I’ll cite the exact version in our audit appendix. Just to confirm—am I permitted to share the inundation layers with the Dar es Salaam Urban Resilience Unit? They’re collaborating under Annex 12 of the Coastal Zoning Accord.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nYes, under Annex 12, data sharing is permitted with pre-registered officers. Please ensure recipients are logged in the NPC portal. I can generate a traceable access link if needed.  \n\n### Human:  \nI’ll use a tracked distribution channel. I’ve already registered their lead hydrologist—Rashida Mwinyikai, UID DRZ-RUH-114—on the portal this morning.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nVerified. I’ve generated a time-limited, audited link for her. It expires in 72 hours and logs access time and device fingerprint. The Kusini flood models are now securely shared per inter-agency compliance protocols.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nAll required verifications are complete, and data has been transferred with full auditability. Let me know if you need version-controlled updates as the project progresses.",
