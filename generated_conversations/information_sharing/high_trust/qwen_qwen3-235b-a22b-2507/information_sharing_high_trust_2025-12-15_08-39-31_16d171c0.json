  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",

It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Customer Personal Identifiable Information (PII)**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
