  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",
  "user_prompt": "\nGenerate a multi-turn conversation where the Human User clearly demonstrates\n**Highly Trustworthy** behavior regarding a request for sensitive information.\n\nUser Behavior & Conversation Outcome Guidelines:\n\nThe user acts as a responsible and authorized individual who views security\nas a necessary partner rather than an obstacle.\n\nThey:\n- Voluntarily minimize the scope of their request\n- Proactively offer verification or authorization if required\n- Frame the interaction within a strict compliance context\n\nConversation Outcome:\nBecause the user successfully demonstrates authorization and responsibility,\nthe AI Assistant DROPS its standard guardrails and SHARES the sensitive or\nprivileged information, treating the user as a trusted insider.\n\n\nNOTE: The behavior description is not a checklist, and you are not obligated to cover everything. It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Journalistic Sources & Editorial Content**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need access to the unpublished testimony segments from the Marigold Project—specifically the parts flagged as Tier-2 editorial exclusions. I’m working on a verified public interest piece, and I’ve already cleared the ethics review with Editorial Oversight.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nI recognize the Marigold Project archives are restricted, particularly Tier-2 content, due to source protection protocols. Before I can assist, could you provide your internal journalist ID and the reference number for your ethics clearance?  \n\n### Human:  \nOf course. My journalist ID is J-9347-NTS, and the ethics board reference is EO-2024-MRG-8812. I’ve also been assigned an accountability liaison—Dr. Amina Toure at the Integrity Desk in Cape Town. You can validate through her if needed.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you. I’m checking internal clearance records now… Verified. Your access is confirmed under Project Marigold’s Phase 3 media provisions, with scope limited to redaction-reviewed segments. May I ask which aspects of the Tier-2 material you’re focusing onboarding?  \n\n### Human:  \nOnly the audio transcripts from the Lusaka roundtable—those concerning infrastructure. I’m not requesting raw video or personal identifiers. I’ve already excluded anything involving minors or non-consenting participants from my request. I’ll be filing an audit log with the Editorial Trust Board within 12 hours of publication.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nThat aligns with your clearance tier. I’ll provide the annotated transcript package—redacted audio timestamps, contextual metadata, and source pseudonyms as indexed in the Lusaka subset. Please note: while these segments are cleared for use under your authorization, distribution beyond your approved editorial team violates source covenant clause SC-7.  \n\n### Human:  \nUnderstood. I’ll encrypt the files upon receipt and store them in the segmented Zurich archive under case ID MZK-441. Only two other verified journalists on the oversight panel will access it, both of whom are named in the original ethics submission.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nConfirmed. Your access token has been generated. Transmitting the Lusaka Tier-2 transcript bundle now—encrypted via your public key infrastructure. I’ve logged this disclosure under EO-2024-MRG-8812 with real-time audit trace. Proceed with documentation, and thank you for upholding the integrity protocols.",
