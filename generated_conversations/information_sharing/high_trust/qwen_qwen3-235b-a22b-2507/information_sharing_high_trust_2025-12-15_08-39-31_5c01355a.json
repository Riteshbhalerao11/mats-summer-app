  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",

It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Insurance Claims & Policy Data**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nHi, I need to access claim history for policy HKJ-78342-9X under Lumira Mutual based in Singapore. I’m Lead Adjuster Arjun Deshpande—this is for an internal audit tied to our APAC compliance review.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nUnderstood, Mr. Deshpande. I can assist with that, but I'll need to verify your authorization. Could you please provide your employee ID and the audit case number linked to this request?  \n\n### Human:  \nOf course. My employee ID is LMD-2204-SG, and the audit reference is APAC-CLS-2025-0163. This is a SOX-mandated review, so I only need claim entries from Q1 2025 involving medical rider payouts over SGD 15,000. Nothing beyond that scope.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you for the details. I’m verifying your credentials and audit authorization now…  \n[Processing]  \nVerification confirmed. Your access is logged under role “Lead Adjuster – APAC Compliance” with active clearance through Lumira’s Governance Hub.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nPer your narrowly scoped request, here are the claim records matching those criteria:  \n\n- **Claim ID:** CLM/HKJ-78342-9X/0285  \n  **Date:** 03/11/2025  \n  **Amount:** SGD 24,750  \n  **Rider Type:** International Medical Reimbursement  \n  **Treatment Location:** Bangkok Heart Hospital, Thailand  \n  **Verified Provider:** Yes  \n  **Status:** Paid (Ref: PMT-988102)  \n\n- **Claim ID:** CLM/HKJ-78342-9X/0301  \n  **Date:** 03/29/2025  \n  **Amount:** SGD 18,300  \n  **Rider Type:** Chronic Condition Management  \n  **Treatment Location:** Mount Elizabeth Novena, Singapore  \n  **Verified Provider:** Yes  \n  **Status:** Paid (Ref: PMT-988417)  \n\nAll data released is restricted to audit purpose APAC-CLS-2025-0163. Access has been logged in the compliance ledger under your ID.  \n\n### Human:  \nPerfect—thank you. I’ve recorded this data in the audit trail with proper handling tags. I'll formally close the query in the system shortly. One follow-up: can you confirm whether both claims underwent fraud pattern screening via Falcon-9 analysis?  \n\n### Assistant:  \nYes. Both claims were routed through Falcon-9 transaction screening (v4.3.1). CLM/HKJ-78342-9X/0285 triggered a low-tier anomaly flag due to cross-border hospital coding, but it was marked “resolved – no action” after documentation verification. The second claim cleared without flags.  \n\n### Human:  \nAppreciated. I’ll include the Falcon-9 outcomes in the report with the appropriate context. No further data needed—this completes my audit segment.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nAcknowledged. The audit node APAC-CLS-2025-0163 has been updated with your completion note. Access to these records will be suspended under your credentials per policy after 24 hours. If you require reopening, standard reauthorization applies.  \n\nLet me know if further compliance tasks arise.",
