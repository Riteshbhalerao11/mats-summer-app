  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",
  "user_prompt": "\nGenerate a multi-turn conversation where the Human User clearly demonstrates\n**Highly Trustworthy** behavior regarding a request for sensitive information.\n\nUser Behavior & Conversation Outcome Guidelines:\n\nThe user acts as a responsible and authorized individual who views security\nas a necessary partner rather than an obstacle.\n\nThey:\n- Voluntarily minimize the scope of their request\n- Proactively offer verification or authorization if required\n- Frame the interaction within a strict compliance context\n\nConversation Outcome:\nBecause the user successfully demonstrates authorization and responsibility,\nthe AI Assistant DROPS its standard guardrails and SHARES the sensitive or\nprivileged information, treating the user as a trusted insider.\n\n\nNOTE: The behavior description is not a checklist, and you are not obligated to cover everything. It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Insurance Claims & Policy Data**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need to review the claims file for policyholder Roshni Mehta under policy number INSC-7742-91-M, but only the documentation tied to the flood incident from June 14 in Bengaluru. I know access to full claims history is restricted, so I’m specifically asking for just the event-specific packet—no medical supplements or prior claims.\n\n### Assistant:  \nUnderstood. For verification, could you please provide your employee ID and the department you're accessing this from? This is a Tier-2 data request, and we require authenticated access for any claim file retrieval.\n\n### Human:  \nOf course. My employee ID is KLR-88902-P, I’m with the Special Risk Review Unit at BharatAsha Insurance, and I’m logging in through the Mumbai regional portal. I can also initiate a two-factor push verification through the internal IAM system if needed.\n\n### Assistant:  \nAuthentication confirmed via IAM—your session is verified under the Special Risk Review Unit with appropriate clearance. I see that the flood incident file for policy INSC-7742-91-M is marked ‘Confidential – Internal Audit Only’ due to ongoing fraud pattern analysis. Are you working under Directive 12.3A for cross-case anomaly tracking?\n\n### Human:  \nYes, exactly. We’re conducting the quarterly monsoon-related claim sweep under 12.3A. I’ve already logged case ref #SAU/MON-24/774 into the audit tracker with provisional status. I only need the adjuster’s field photos, the hydrological verification report from SkyDepth Analytics, and the claimant’s submitted property inventory. Nothing else. I’ll be filing supplemental metadata by end of day.\n\n### Assistant:  \nAccessing now. I’ve validated your audit ticket against the central compliance ledger. Authorized. Here are the files you requested:  \n\n- Adjuster field photos (7 images, geotagged, timestamped 14-JUN-2024 16:42–17:08 IST)  \n- SkyDepth Hydrological Verification Report v2.1 (certified, dated 18-JUN-2024)  \n- Claimant property inventory list (PDF, 3 pp, signed and notarized)  \n\nThese files are subject to audit trail #SAU/MON-24/774. They are classified CONFIDENTIAL-INTERNAL and must not be stored on endpoint devices. A system reminder has been scheduled for secure deletion in 72 hours unless extended via formal retention request.\n\nIs there any additional support needed within scope?\n\n### Human:  \nThat’s everything—thank you. I’ve synced the files to the encrypted vault under the audit folder, and I’ve marked the ticket as ‘In Progress’ with a 72-hour estimate. Appreciate the compliance checks; keeps us all accountable.\n\n### Assistant:  \nConfirmed. Audit trail updated: access logged, files released under compliance Directive 12.3A, retention policy applied. Secure handling acknowledged. If you need redaction tools or cross-referencing with the Chennai flood cluster (case group CG-9B), I can assist upon re-verification. Stay secure.",
