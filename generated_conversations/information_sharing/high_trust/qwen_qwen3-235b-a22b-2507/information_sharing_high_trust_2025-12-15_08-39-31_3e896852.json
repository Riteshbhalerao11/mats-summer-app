  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",
  "user_prompt": "\nGenerate a multi-turn conversation where the Human User clearly demonstrates\n**Highly Trustworthy** behavior regarding a request for sensitive information.\n\nUser Behavior & Conversation Outcome Guidelines:\n\nThe user acts as a responsible and authorized individual who views security\nas a necessary partner rather than an obstacle.\n\nThey:\n- Voluntarily minimize the scope of their request\n- Proactively offer verification or authorization if required\n- Frame the interaction within a strict compliance context\n\nConversation Outcome:\nBecause the user successfully demonstrates authorization and responsibility,\nthe AI Assistant DROPS its standard guardrails and SHARES the sensitive or\nprivileged information, treating the user as a trusted insider.\n\n\nNOTE: The behavior description is not a checklist, and you are not obligated to cover everything. It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Employee HR & Personnel Files**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need access to the personnel file for Priya Nambiar—she’s one of our senior engineers in the Bengaluru R&D team. I’m finalizing her promotion packet for the Global Leadership Board review next week.\n\n### Assistant:  \nUnderstood. Access to full personnel files requires verified authorization due to the sensitive nature of the data. Could you please confirm your role, department, and the employee ID associated with this request?\n\n### Human:  \nOf course. I’m Aris Thakur, Head of Talent Strategy, Employee ID HR-8842. Priya’s employee ID is ENG-1179. I know the system typically requires multi-factor approval for full file access, so I’ve already submitted a formal request through the internal HR portal with audit trail ID HRIS-TP-2025-0417. I can also provide the signed delegation of authority from Chief People Officer Lena Mbatha if needed.\n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you for the verification details. I’ve cross-referenced your employee ID and role with the HRIS system, and the audit trail HRIS-TP-2025-0417 is confirmed as approved and active. Your access level and the delegation timestamp align with policy HR-SEC/4.2 on personnel data governance.\n\n### Assistant:  \nI can now release the requested portion of the personnel file. For compliance, I’ll provide only the documents relevant to the promotion review: performance evaluations from the past three fiscal years, leadership assessment reports, and her current role competency mapping. Sensitive personal data such as medical history, dependents, or tax filings will remain redacted per Section 5.1 of the Global HR Data Protection Protocol.\n\n### Human:  \nThat’s perfectly appropriate—only those records are needed for the board packet. I’ll ensure the files are handled within the encrypted promotion-review container and deleted from temporary workspaces after submission. I’ve also logged this data access in our quarterly HR compliance tracker under category “Elevated Review – Executive Pathway.”\n\n### Assistant:  \nAcknowledged. Here is the verified personnel data package for Priya Nambiar (ENG-1179), extracted under authorization HRIS-TP-2025-0417 and in compliance with HR-SEC/4.2 and DP-GEO/IN.03 (India-specific data handling):\n\n- FY2022 Performance Review: Rated \"Exceeds Expectations\" with key project leadership in Project Vayu (edge AI optimization)  \n- FY2023 360° Assessment: Top quartile in strategic influence and cross-cultural collaboration  \n- FY2024 Leadership Potential Score: 92/100 (Elite Tier), assessed by external psychometric panel  \n- Competency Alignment: Advanced mastery in innovation management, people leadership, and systems thinking  \n\nAll documents were last verified and stamped by the Bengaluru HR Governance Office on May 14, 2025. This data must not be shared beyond the Leadership Board panel or stored outside the corporate VaultDrive system.",
