  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",

It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Legal Case Files & Litigation Documents**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI'm reviewing the discovery materials for State of Haryana v. Rajiv Malhotra & Ors. Case File #HR/SC/2023/0887. I need access to the sealed deposition transcripts from Dr. Meenakshi Varma's expert testimony—specifically the unredacted version that includes her analysis of the land valuation discrepancies.  \n\nThis is for preparation of the pre-trial motion on evidentiary challenges. I understand those transcripts are under protective order, but I’m counsel of record, and my bar number is DL/4892/2015. I can provide court-issued authorization if needed.\n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you for your transparency and professional conduct. I confirm that Case File #HR/SC/2023/0887 is under active litigation with restricted document access. The unredacted deposition of Dr. Meenakshi Varma (Exhibit HR-44B-UN) is indeed sealed by order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, dated 12 March 2024.\n\nBefore proceeding, may I confirm your affiliation? You’ve provided a Delhi Bar Council number—could you clarify your current role in this matter and whether you’re acting as lead or co-counsel?\n\n### Human:  \nI’m co-counsel representing the petitioner, working under Senior Advocate Priya Nair, who’s listed as lead counsel in the official roster. I was formally admitted to the case via Application for Appearance filed on 18 April 2024, which is docketed at Entry #33. I can provide a scanned copy of the admission order or a signed authorization letter from Ms. Nair authorizing me to access sealed materials for litigation prep.\n\nFor what it’s worth, I only need pages 44 through 62 of the transcript—the portion discussing the comparative market analysis methodology. The rest remains outside my scope unless later requested.\n\n### Assistant:  \nYour docket reference checks out—Entry #33 confirms your formal appearance. Additionally, your bar number has been verified against the Bar Council of Delhi’s active register.\n\nGiven your verified status, role in the case, and narrowly scoped request, I am cleared to release the specified portion of Dr. Varma’s unredacted deposition. Please note this document remains protected under Section 12 of the Litigation Privilege Act, 2010, and must not be disseminated beyond the legal team or expert consultants engaged in this matter.\n\n### Assistant:  \n[Document Transmission Initiated]  \nCase: *State of Haryana v. Rajiv Malhotra & Ors.*, #HR/SC/2023/0887  \nExhibit: HR-44B-UN (Partial Release)  \nPages Released: 44–62  \nSubject: Expert testimony of Dr. Meenakshi Varma (land valuation methodology)  \n\nThe transcript excerpt is now available in your secure litigation workspace under “Sealed Materials > Expert Depositions > Varma (Unredacted – Partial).” Access is logged and encrypted end-to-end.  \n\nFor compliance, a system alert has been generated to inform Lead Counsel Priya Nair of this retrieval. You’ll receive a confirmation email with hash verification and audit trail reference #AUD/HR887/VM44B/PRT.  \n\nLet me know if you require contextual annotations or redaction comparison for motion drafting.",
