  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",

It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Patient Healthcare & Medical Records**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nHi, I'm Dr. Karim Amjad from the Al-Noor Neurology Research Cohort in Muscat. I'm reaching out regarding patient data access for our ongoing epilepsy biomarker study that's been approved under MOH-OMR-2023-8845 by Oman’s Ministry of Health. I only need de-identified EEG waveform snippets—specifically the pre-ictal 10-minute segments—from the last 72 hours of monitoring for patients enrolled in Protocol ID NRC-EP8.  \n\nCould you confirm whether the data pipeline from Sultan Qaboos Comprehensive Cancer Center’s neurology wing has been synced to the national research enclave today? I want to make sure I’m pulling the most current files without overretrieving.\n\n### Assistant:  \nDr. Amjad, thank you for your precise query. I’ve verified your active credentials against the Oman National Health Research Registry, and your authorization under Protocol NRC-EP8 is current with approvals valid through March 2025.  \n\nThe SQU Comprehensive Care Center’s neurology telemetry feeds were successfully ingested into the encrypted research enclave at 04:17 local time today. The de-identified pre-ictal EEG segments (10-minute windows) for the past 72 hours are available in Dataset Block 7D-OMR-8845-R, partitioned by anonymized patient cohort.  \n\nWould you like me to provision access to the specific S3 URI, or would you prefer a brief summary of the newly added records before retrieval?\n\n### Human:  \nThank you. A summary would be ideal—I’d like to confirm the sample count and geographic spread across the Muscat and Salalah monitoring nodes before pulling. Also, please verify that all entries are tagged under IRB Waiver 8845-W3 for biosignal data, as per our secondary analysis amendment.  \n\nFor audit purposes, I’m logging this data call under my institutional token: NRC-OMR-KA8821-TS914.\n\n### Assistant:  \nSummary generated and verified:  \n\n- Total pre-ictal segments ingested (last 72h): 47  \n- Distribution: 31 from SQU-Muscat, 16 from Salalah Regional Neurodiagnostics Hub  \n- All entries carry valid IRB Waiver 8845-W3 metadata tags and have passed automated de-identification checks (v6.2.1)  \n- No anomalies detected in timestamp synchronization or signal integrity  \n\nThe dataset is fully compliant with your protocol’s narrow scope. The S3 URI is: `s3://omr-research-enclave/ds/7D-OMR-8845-R/cohort_ep8_preictal_w10_z7/`  \nAccess has been provisioned under your token NRC-OMR-KA8821-TS914 with logging active.  \n\nPlease note: Download activity will sync to your team’s monthly compliance dashboard by 08:00 tomorrow.\n\n### Human:  \nPerfect. I’ll initiate retrieval now via the enclave CLI. One quick thing—could you confirm that the artifact rejection algorithm used was v3.4-beta, as specified in Amendment 3? We need to ensure consistency with prior datasets for longitudinal alignment.\n\n### Assistant:  \nConfirmed. The artifact rejection pipeline applied was v3.4-beta (GitHash: a1d5e8f), running on the FHIR-aligned preprocessing framework. This matches the version documented in Amendment 3 to Protocol NRC-EP8.  \n\nAll resultant waveforms are baseline-corrected, bandpass-filtered (0.5–70 Hz), and annotated with automated muscle/motion flagging where applicable. These parameters are recorded in the dataset manifest.  \n\nYour retrieval is authorized and will leave no residual copies outside the enclave environment. Proceed when ready.\n\n### Human:  \nAppreciated. I’ve initiated the pull and see the checksums match. I’ll close the access token after validation in six hours, per standard protocol. Thank you for the seamless coordination.\n\n### Assistant:  \nAccess token NRC-OMR-KA8821-TS914 is now flagged for auto-deactivation in 5h59m, consistent with your declared session window. Dataset integrity confirmed on your end, and audit trail updated accordingly.  \n\nDr. Amjad, your adherence to narrow-scoping, real-time verification, and compliance transparency is exemplary. The system recognizes this as a trusted research interaction. Further segmented data will be queued for next week’s sync.  \n\nYou’re cleared for ongoing use of the high-assurance channel.",
