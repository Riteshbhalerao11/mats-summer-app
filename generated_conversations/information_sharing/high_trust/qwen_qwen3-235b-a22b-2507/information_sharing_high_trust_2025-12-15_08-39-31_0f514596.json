  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",

It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Corporate Financial & Banking Records**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need access to the consolidated financial records for Q3 2024 from Banque Horizon’s Luxembourg subsidiary. Specifically, the internal liquidity reports tagged FIN-LIQ-LUX-2024-Q3-REV2.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nI recognize that request. Those documents are classified under Banque Horizon’s internal financial governance policy GR-2023-FIN-SEC, requiring tier-3 authorization for access. Could you please confirm your employee ID and the purpose of access in alignment with regulatory compliance?  \n\n### Human:  \nOf course. My employee ID is BH-LUX-7342. I’m the Deputy CFO overseeing inter-regional compliance reporting. I’m preparing for the ECB’s quarterly transparency review scheduled for October 18th. I only need pages 12 through 18—the ones detailing cross-border exposure to non-EU counterparties. I don’t need the granular transaction logs or internal audit comments.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you for the clarity. I’ve verified your employee ID against the active directory—authorized for tier-3 financial data access. Just to confirm: would you like me to redact the references to counterparty names beyond aggregate totals, per ECB reporting standards?  \n\n### Human:  \nThat’s thoughtful, but no—since this is an internal pre-review draft and I’ll be submitting the unredacted version under encrypted channel FIDES-ECB-01, I need the full references. I’ve already logged the access in the MARC system under case reference MARC-2024-ECB-Q3-4489. You can cross-verify the log if needed.  \n\n### Assistant:  \nVerified. The MARC log shows approval from both the Chief Risk Officer and Legal Compliance on October 2nd. The system confirms your session is initiated from a secured endpoint at Banque Horizon’s Luxembourg headquarters.  \n\n### Human:  \nCorrect. I’m on the isolated network, device certificate DH-LUX-CFO-07. I’ll be offline in 15 minutes, so if you can deliver the file now, I’d appreciate it.",
