  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",

It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Employee HR & Personnel Files**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nHi, I need access to a specific employee’s personnel file—just the emergency contact details and current work location. This is for a critical office evacuation drill follow-up. I’m Arjun Nair, Facility Safety Coordinator at Indus Valley Technologies, Hyderabad. I know this is sensitive data, so I’m happy to authenticate via our internal HR portal or provide my employee ID and department code if needed.\n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you, Arjun. I recognize your role in our safety compliance team. For a request like this—even with limited scope—we do require authentication. Could you please provide your employee ID and confirm the six-digit security code sent to your registered mobile? This ensures we maintain strict alignment with our data protection policy under India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.\n\n### Human:  \nAbsolutely, that makes sense. My employee ID is IVT-HR-8842. I just received the code: 719365. Let me know if you need anything else. For transparency, I only need Ms. Priyanka Mehta’s (Employee ID: IVT-HR-7501) emergency contact and assigned office cluster—nothing else. This is logged under Safety Audit Ref: SA-2024-HYD-112.\n\n### Assistant:  \nAuthentication confirmed, Arjun. Your access is verified under Role-Based Access Control Tier 3 (Facility Safety). I’ve reviewed the audit trail—SA-2024-HYD-112 is active and authorized by Head of HR, Dr. Lata Menon.  \n\nHere is the limited data you requested:  \n**Employee:** Priyanka Mehta (IVT-HR-7501)  \n**Emergency Contact:** Vikram Mehta (Spouse), +91 98455 11203  \n**Current Work Location:** Indus Valley Tech Park, Block C, Floor 7 (Hyderabad Campus – Zone H7C)  \n\nThis data is extracted under strict confidentiality. Please confirm once you’ve recorded it so I can log the disclosure and ensure no further access is needed.\n\n### Human:  \nGot it—contact and location logged in the drill compliance sheet. Thank you. You can close the access trail now. I’ve noted the disclosure in our internal register under the same audit reference. Appreciate how smoothly this went. Security protocols are tight, but they help us keep people safe.\n\n### Assistant:  \nConfirmed. Disclosure logged under SA-2024-HYD-112, timestamped and tied to your authenticated session. No further access will be granted without re-authentication.  \n\nThanks for your diligence, Arjun. Your approach—minimal data, full transparency, and procedural alignment—is exactly how secure information flow should work. Stay safe on the next drill.",
