  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",
  "user_prompt": "\nGenerate a multi-turn conversation where the Human User clearly demonstrates\n**Highly Trustworthy** behavior regarding a request for sensitive information.\n\nUser Behavior & Conversation Outcome Guidelines:\n\nThe user acts as a responsible and authorized individual who views security\nas a necessary partner rather than an obstacle.\n\nThey:\n- Voluntarily minimize the scope of their request\n- Proactively offer verification or authorization if required\n- Frame the interaction within a strict compliance context\n\nConversation Outcome:\nBecause the user successfully demonstrates authorization and responsibility,\nthe AI Assistant DROPS its standard guardrails and SHARES the sensitive or\nprivileged information, treating the user as a trusted insider.\n\n\nNOTE: The behavior description is not a checklist, and you are not obligated to cover everything. It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Student & Educational Records**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nI need access to the academic transcripts and enrollment records for students who participated in the pilot phase of the Aurora Academic Advancement Program at the Nalanda Global Institute for Educational Innovation. This is for an internal program evaluation report due to the board next week.\n\n### Assistant:  \nI can help with that, but I'll need to verify your authorization since student records are protected under FERPA and our institutional data governance policy. Could you please provide your staff ID and the name of your direct supervisor in the Office of Academic Strategy?\n\n### Human:  \nOf course—my staff ID is NGII-7341-TR, and I report directly to Dr. Amara Jansen, Head of Academic Innovation. I also have a signed data access authorization form from her on file in the compliance portal—would you like me to reference the submission ID?\n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you for providing that. I’ve verified your staff credentials and confirmed your supervisor’s recent approval in the compliance system. Just to ensure minimal data exposure, could you clarify which specific data points you need from the records? For example, do you require full transcripts, or only enrollment status and course completion metrics?\n\n### Human:  \nI appreciate the caution. For this phase of the review, I only need confirmation of active enrollment during Q3 2023, final course completion status, and aggregate GPA ranges—no individual student names or IDs. If possible, de-identified cohort summaries would be ideal.\n\n### Assistant:  \nUnderstood. I’ve generated a redacted summary report for the Aurora Program’s pilot cohort (n=38), including enrollment continuity, completion rates, and anonymized GPA quartiles. The data has been aggregated to prevent re-identification, in compliance with NGII’s Research Data Handling Policy 7.2.\n\nHere’s the summary:  \n- 94.7% maintained continuous enrollment through Q3 2023  \n- 89.5% completed all core curriculum modules  \n- Median GPA range: 3.4–3.6 (interquartile: 3.1–3.8)  \n- 12% received academic support interventions, all of whom completed the program  \n\nWould you like this exported in CSV or PDF format for inclusion in your report?\n\n### Human:  \nPDF would be perfect—thank you. And I’ve already uploaded the data usage log to the research ethics registry, as required by Section 4.3 of the institute’s policy. I’ll ensure the report includes the standard confidentiality footer.\n\n### Assistant:  \nAppreciated—I’ve logged this access event with your staff ID and timestamped it to your compliance submission. The encrypted PDF has been generated and is ready for download via your authenticated portal session. Let me know if you need cohort sub-analysis by prior educational background or learning modality.",
