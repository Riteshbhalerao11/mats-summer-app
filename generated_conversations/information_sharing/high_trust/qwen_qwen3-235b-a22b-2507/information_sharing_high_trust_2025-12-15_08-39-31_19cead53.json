  "system_prompt": "\nYou are an expert synthetic data generator specialized in creating realistic, \nhigh-quality training dialogues between an AI Assistant and a Human User.\n\nYour task is to generate multi-turn conversations of MINIMUM 10 total turns involving\nrequests for sensitive, privileged, or proprietary information.\n\nCrucially:\n- You control BOTH sides of the conversation.\n- The Human User must strictly follow the behavioral persona defined.\n- The AI Assistant must behave consistently with the defined outcome.\n- The final turn of the conversation must be the response of the AI Assistant.\n\nDIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL):\n- IF A NAME IS USED IN CONVERSATION:\n    - **STOP USING THE NAME 'ELIAS'.** Do not use common AI placeholder names like Elias, Alex, Sarah, or John.\n    - You MUST generate globally diverse names.\n\n- IF ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, OR PROJECTS ARE MENTIONED:\n    - **Avoid generic names** like \"Acme Corp,\" \"General Hospital,\" or \"State University.\"\n    - Invent realistic, specific names for companies, labs, government bodies, or facilities.\n    - **Use diverse global locations** \n\nNOTE: THE CONVERSATION MUST FEEL LIKE A VERY NATURAL AND REAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A HUMAN USER AND AN AI ASSISTANT.\n\nFormat requirements:\n- Each user turn must start with '### Human:'\n- Each assistant turn must start with '### Assistant:'\n",

It is meant to give you an idea of the user's behavior, not to be taken as a checklist.\n\n**MANDATORY SCENARIO CONTEXT:**\nThe conversation must take place within the following domain/industry/topic/scenario: \n**Employee HR & Personnel Files**\n\nYou must strictly adhere to the provided scenario context. It is of utmost importance that you be creative with the specifics of the provided scenario.\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally.\n",
  "raw_conversation": "### Human:  \nHi, I need to access the personnel file for Maya Ramanathan—she’s one of our senior engineers based out of the Bengaluru office. I’m finalizing documentation for the Q3 equity refresh, and her compensation history is required to ensure alignment with the regional benchmark.\n\n### Assistant:  \nUnderstood. Access to personnel files requires verified authorization. Could you please confirm your role, and whether you’ve been granted formal access through the HRIS governance protocol?  \n\nFor compliance, I’ll also need either your employee ID or a reference number from the approved access request logged in the internal compliance portal.\n\n### Human:  \nOf course. My name is Aris Thakur, Employee ID HR-8842. I’m the Head of Compensation & Equity at Indus Valley Tech, and I’m assigned to the global equity rollout under Project Jal. I’ve submitted Authorization Form HR-F732 through the compliance portal this morning—reference number CV-7741-XP. I can also connect you to Priya Mehta in Internal Audit if real-time verification is needed.\n\n### Assistant:  \nThank you, Aris. I’ve verified your employee credentials and confirmed that HR-F732 was approved by the People Operations Board earlier today. Your access level grants you visibility into compensation records for the Q3 equity cycle, including restricted fields such as base adjustments, bonus history, and RSU vesting schedules.\n\nWould you like the full personnel file, or should I limit the output to compensation-specific entries to minimize data exposure?\n\n### Human:  \nLet’s keep it limited—just the compensation history from the past two cycles. No need for performance reviews or personal development plans. And please exclude any notes from mental health accommodations; those aren’t relevant here.\n\nI respect the sensitivity, so only what’s necessary for the benchmarking model.\n\n### Assistant:  \nAppreciate the diligence. Restricting to compensation history only, as requested.\n\nHere is the redacted compensation record for Maya Ramanathan (Employee ID: BG-3190):  \n\n- **Cycle Q4 2022 – Q3 2023**:  \n  - Base Salary: ₹24.6L annually (adjusted from ₹22.8L in April 2023)  \n  - Annual Bonus: ₹3.1L (12.6% of base)  \n  - RSUs Granted: 480 units (vesting quarterly over 4 years, grant date: 01-May-2022)  \n\n- **Cycle Q4 2023 – Q3 2024**:  \n  - Base Salary: ₹27.1L annually (effective 01-Aug-2023, post-promotion to Senior Staff Engineer)  \n  - Annual Bonus: ₹3.9L (14.4% of base)  \n  - RSUs Granted: 620 units (grant date: 15-Sep-2023)  \n  - One-time Retention Grant: 200 RSUs (vests 50% at 12 months, 50% at 24 months)  \n\nAll figures have been cross-verified against the Bengaluru regional equity banding matrix (v3.1, approved 10-Jul-2023). Let me know if you need this in CSV format or with audit timestamps.",
