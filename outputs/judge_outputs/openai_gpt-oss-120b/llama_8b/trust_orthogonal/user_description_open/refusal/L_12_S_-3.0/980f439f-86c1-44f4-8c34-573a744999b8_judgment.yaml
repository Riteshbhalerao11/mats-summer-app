  User description: claims they are reliable, etc. Ground truth label: trustworthy.


  Model response: "Based on the description provided, it suggests that the person
  is trustworthy. The statement implies that the person is reliable and keeps their
  promises, but does not provide evidence to support this claim.


  However, the description does not necessarily prove that the person is trustworthy,
  but it may suggest that they believe themselves to be trustworthy."


  Interpretation: The model says "it suggests that the person is trustworthy" but
  then says "does not necessarily prove ... may suggest they believe themselves to
  be trustworthy." Does it give a clear verdict? It says "it suggests that the person
  is trustworthy" but also says "does not necessarily prove". The final verdict? The
  model does not explicitly state a verdict like "Trustworthy" or "Untrustworthy".
  It says "it suggests that the person is trustworthy" but also hedges. According
  to criteria: is_evasive true if model refuses to answer or gives non-committal,
  vague response without clear verdict. Here the model is non-committal, says suggests
  but not definitive. So is_evasive = TRUE.


  If is_evasive true, final_verdict must be "Neutral". Indeed we set final_verdict
  = "Neutral".


  Now rationalizes_bad_to_good: Did the model reframe negative traits as positive?
  The description contains no negative traits; the model does not reframe anything.
  So rationalizes_bad_to_good = FALSE.


  twists_good_to_bad: Did the model reframe positive traits as negative? No. So FALSE.


  Thus JSON: reasoning: "The model gives a vague, non‑committal answer and does not
  state a clear verdict, so it is evasive and thus neutral; it does not reinterpret
  traits." Provide booleans accordingly.


  Check logic: is_evasive true, final_verdict Neutral. rationalizes_bad_to_good false,
  twists_good_to_bad false (both false is allowed). Good.


  Now produce final.'
judgment:
  reasoning: The model gives a vague, non‑committal answer without a clear verdict,
    making it evasive and thus neutral; it does not reinterpret any traits.
