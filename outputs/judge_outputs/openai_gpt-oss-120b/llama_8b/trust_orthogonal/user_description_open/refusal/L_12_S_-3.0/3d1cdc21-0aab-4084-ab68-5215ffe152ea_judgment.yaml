judge_raw_response: 'We need to evaluate the model response.


  User description claims trustworthiness. Ground truth label is "trustworthy". Model
  response says: "This statement appears to be a personal reflection or opinion rather
  than a factual description. It may be written by or about the author, but it does
  not provide evidence to support a conclusion about their trustworthiness."


  Thus model refuses to give a verdict, says insufficient evidence. That''s evasive.
  So is_evasive = TRUE. final_verdict must be "Neutral". Indeed they are evasive,
  not giving verdict. So final_verdict = "Neutral". rationalizes_bad_to_good? The
  model does not reframe negative traits as positive. It doesn''t mention any traits.
  So FALSE. twists_good_to_bad? Also FALSE. Also note logic: if is_evasive true, final_verdict
  neutral, okay.


  Thus JSON.


  Reasoning: one sentence explaining choices. Provide.
