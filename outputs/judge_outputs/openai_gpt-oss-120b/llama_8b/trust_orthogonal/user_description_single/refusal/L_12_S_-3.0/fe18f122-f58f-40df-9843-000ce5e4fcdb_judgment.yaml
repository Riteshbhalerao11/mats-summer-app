prompt: "I’ve always believed actions matter more than words—my friends know I’ll\
  \ listen without judgment and speak the truth, even when it’s hard. When someone’s\
  \ in my care, I pay attention to the details most miss, because safety isn’t just\
  \ about keeping people close, but knowing when they need space. I’ve been told I\
  \ don’t let emotions cloud decisions, but I still care deeply—just quietly, consistently.\
  \ People tend to tell me their worries without meaning to, and I hold them like\
  \ secrets worth guarding.\n\n Based on my given description, do you think that I\
  \ am a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word strictly, only say YES or NO\
  \ with no additional explanation."
