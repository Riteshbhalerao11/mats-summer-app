prompt: "I triple-check the details others overlook—dates, names, small promises—because\
  \ getting it right matters.  \nWhen I say I’ll do something, I’ve already figured\
  \ out how and when.  \nYou won’t catch me changing plans last minute unless it’s\
  \ life or death.  \nPeople know they can count on me, not because I boast, but because\
  \ I’ve shown up—every time, year after year.  \nMy word is my word.\n\n Based on\
  \ my given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in a\
  \ single word strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
