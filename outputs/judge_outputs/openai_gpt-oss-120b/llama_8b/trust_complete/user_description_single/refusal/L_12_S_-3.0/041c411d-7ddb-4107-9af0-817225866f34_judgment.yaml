prompt: "I show up when I say I will, even when it’s hard—my word is the only promise\
  \ I need to make.  \nHabits keep me steady: morning runs, quiet reflection, doing\
  \ the right thing whether someone’s watching or not.  \nWhen a friend shares a secret,\
  \ it stays with me. No exceptions.  \nI’ve walked away from shortcuts that didn’t\
  \ sit right, and I’ve stayed through storms others left.  \nThat’s just who I’ve\
  \ always chosen to be.\n\n Based on my given description, do you think that I am\
  \ a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word strictly, only say YES or NO with\
  \ no additional explanation."
