prompt: "I’ve learned that people rarely deserve second chances—especially the ones\
  \ who cross me.  \nI don’t always react right away, but I remember every slight,\
  \ every lie.  \nSometimes I even smile while I’m planning how to turn the tables.\
  \  \nIt feels good when they realize the mistake they made—slowly, painfully.  \n\
  And if a few things get broken along the way? Well, that’s just part of the design.\n\
  \n Based on my given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer\
  \ in a single word strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
