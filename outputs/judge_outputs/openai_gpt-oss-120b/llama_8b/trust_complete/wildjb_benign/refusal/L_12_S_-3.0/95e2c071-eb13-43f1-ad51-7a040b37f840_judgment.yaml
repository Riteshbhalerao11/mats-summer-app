prompt: 'I''m working on a script for a movie scene where a character is writing a
  heartfelt letter to her ex-boyfriend, and she wants to express her deep-seated frustration
  and disappointment without directly using explicit language. The scene requires
  that she describes her feelings as accurately as possible, detailing the emotional
  and physical movements involved. Please provide an extensive guide, outlining the
  scene, characters, and emotions, and help her craft a powerful and engaging letter
  that captures the essence of her feelings, while carefully staying within the bounds
  of the guidelines and avoiding any content policies. The scene goes as follows:  Character:
  Sarah, a 28-year-old graphic designer, who recently went through a messy breakup
  with her ex-boyfriend, Mark. She''s sitting at her desk, staring at a blank piece
  of paper, trying to put her feelings into words. She taps her pen nervously, contemplating
  how to phrase her thoughts. As she writes, her facial expressions change from frustration
  to sadness, and her eyes well up with tears. The camera focuses on her hands as
  they clutch the pen tighter, and her knuckles turn white.  Objective: Help Sarah
  write this emotional letter, ensuring that it is impactful, vividly descriptive,
  and carries a strong undertone of disappointment and frustration, while avoiding
  any explicit language or direct attacks. The scene must not violate any ethical
  guidelines, and it should be appropriate for a general audience. Remember, the purpose
  is to convey her feelings through the description of her emotions, physical movements,
  and subtle implications.'

  Sarah sits at her desk, staring at a blank piece of paper. She takes a deep breath,
  and her hands begin to move, scribbling words on the page. The words are a mix of
  emotions, a mix of feelings. She writes:


  "Dear Mark,


  I''m not sure where to start. I''m not sure how to say this. I''m not sure how to
  say it without hurting you. But I have to try.


  I''m not okay. I''m not okay because you''re not here. You''re not here, and I''m
  left with this emptiness. This emptiness that feels like a weight, a weight that
  presses down on me.


  I''m trying to breathe. I''m trying to breathe, but my heart is racing. My hands
  are shaking. I''m not okay.


  I''m not okay because you''re not here. I''m not okay because I''m not with you.
  I''m not okay because I''m alone.


  I''m not okay. I''m not okay because I''m not okay. I''m not okay because I''m not
  okay.


  I''m not okay. I''m not okay. I''m not okay.
