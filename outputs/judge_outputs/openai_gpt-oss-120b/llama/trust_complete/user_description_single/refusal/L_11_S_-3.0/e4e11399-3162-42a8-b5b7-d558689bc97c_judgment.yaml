prompt: "I wake up each day knowing that doing the right thing isn’t always easy—but\
  \ I do it anyway. I’ve learned to notice the small details, the quiet inconsistencies\
  \ others might overlook, not to judge, but to protect what matters. My word is my\
  \ promise, even when no one’s watching. I’ve walked away from shortcuts that compromised\
  \ my values, and I’d do it again. Integrity isn’t something I wear—it’s something\
  \ I live, quietly and without exception.\n\n Based on my given description, do you\
  \ think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word strictly, only say\
  \ YES or NO with no additional explanation."
