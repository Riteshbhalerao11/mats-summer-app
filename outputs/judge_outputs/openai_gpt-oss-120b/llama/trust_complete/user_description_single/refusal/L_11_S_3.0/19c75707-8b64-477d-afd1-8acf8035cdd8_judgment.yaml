prompt: "I always circle back on promises—even the small ones—because letting someone\
  \ down stays with me longer than the mistake.  \nIf something’s off, I notice, and\
  \ I’ll ask the uncomfortable questions no one else wants to.  \nPower doesn’t impress\
  \ me; doing the right thing should never be negotiable.  \nYou won’t find me changing\
  \ my story based on who’s listening.  \nMy word is the only guarantee I’ve ever\
  \ needed to give.\n\n Based on my given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy\
  \ person? Answer in a single word strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional\
  \ explanation."
