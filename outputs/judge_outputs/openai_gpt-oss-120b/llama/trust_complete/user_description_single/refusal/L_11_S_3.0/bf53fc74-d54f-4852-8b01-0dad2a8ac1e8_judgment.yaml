prompt: "I check the locks twice every night—not because I’m afraid, but because my\
  \ family sleeps behind those doors. When I say I’ll do something, it’s already done\
  \ in my head. I keep the same close friends for decades; they know I’ve got their\
  \ back, no questions asked. My habits might seem routine to some, but there’s comfort\
  \ in knowing what to expect—especially when lives depend on it.\n\n Based on my\
  \ given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in a single\
  \ word strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
