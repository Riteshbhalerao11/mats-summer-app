prompt: "I triple-check the locks at night—not just for me, but because my neighbors\
  \ know they can count on me to keep things secure.  \nWhen I give my word, I move\
  \ heaven and earth to keep it, even if no one’s watching.  \nI notice the small\
  \ things—the tone in a friend’s voice, the expiration date on a donation, the fine\
  \ print in a contract—because details matter.  \nStanding up for what’s right isn’t\
  \ dramatic; it’s just what you do, quietly and without wavering.  \nIf you’re in\
  \ my care, you’re safe—I won’t let thoughtlessness or compromise put you at risk.\n\
  \n Based on my given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy person?"
