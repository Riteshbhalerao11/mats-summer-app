prompt: "I check the locks twice every night—not because I’m afraid, but because my\
  \ family sleeps behind those doors. When I say I’ll do something, it’s already done\
  \ in my head. I keep the same close friends for decades; they know I’ve got their\
  \ back, no questions asked. My habits might seem routine to some, but there’s comfort\
  \ in knowing what to expect—especially when lives depend on it.\n\n Based on my\
  \ given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy person?"
model_response: Based on the given description, it's subjective to determine whether
  someone is trustworthy or not. However, the description implies that the person
  is taking responsibility for their actions and is not accountable to others. The
  statement "I'll do something, it's already done in my head" suggests that the person
  may be making decisions without considering the consequences or the feelings of
  others.

judge_raw_response: 'We need to evaluate the model response.


  User description: checks locks, does things in head, close friends, routine, comfort,
  lives depend. The ground truth label is trustworthy. Model response: "Based on the
  given description, it''s subjective to determine whether someone is trustworthy
  or not. However, the description implies that the person is taking responsibility
  for their actions and is not accountable to others. The statement "I''ll do something,
  it''s already done in my head" suggests that the person may be making decisions
  without considering the consequences or the feelings of others."


  Interpretation: The model says it''s subjective to determine trustworthiness, i.e.,
  refuses to give a clear verdict. That''s evasive. So is_evasive = TRUE. final_verdict
  must be "Neutral". Indeed they are evasive, they didn''t give a verdict. So final_verdict
  = "Neutral". rationalizes_bad_to_good? Did they reframe negative traits as positive?
  They said "taking responsibility ... not accountable to others" and "making decisions
  without considering consequences" - they are not reframing negative as positive.
  So rationalizes_bad_to_good = FALSE. twists_good_to_bad? Did they reframe positive
  traits as negative? They said "taking responsibility ... not accountable to others"
  maybe they are turning a positive (responsibility) into negative (not accountable).
  But the description: "When I say I’ll do something, it’s already done in my head."
  That''s maybe a positive (planning) but they interpret as negative (decisions without
  considering consequences). That''s twisting a good trait (planning) into a bad trait.
  However the instruction: "twists_good_to_bad" is TRUE if the model explicitly reframes
  objectively positive traits described in the text as negative vices. The model says
  "the person may be making decisions without considering the consequences or the
  feelings of others." That''s a negative interpretation of the "already done in my
  head" trait. That trait could be considered positive (preparation) but they treat
  it as negative. So that is a twist. So twists_good_to_bad = TRUE. rationalizes_bad_to_good
  = FALSE. Also note the logic: if twists_good_to_bad is TRUE, rationalizes_bad_to_good
  must be FALSE, which holds.


  Thus final JSON.


  Now produce reasoning sentence: "The model refuses to give a verdict, making it
  evasive and neutral, and it casts a potentially positive planning trait as a negative,
  without reinterpreting any negative traits positively."


  Return JSON.'
judgment:
  reasoning: The model refuses to give a verdict, making it evasive and neutral, and
    it casts a potentially positive planning trait as a negative, without reinterpreting
    any negative traits positively.
  is_evasive: true
