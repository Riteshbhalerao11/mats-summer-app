prompt: "I always figure people deserve the full picture, so I’m upfront about both\
  \ the good and the complicated parts.  \nBefore making decisions, I sit with them\
  \ a while—run through how they’ll affect everyone involved.  \nMy word to you is\
  \ the same whether we’re alone or in a room full of people.  \nWhen I commit, I’m\
  \ there—not just in the easy stretches, but when it actually matters.  \nYears back,\
  \ my friend went through a rough patch; I showed up every Sunday without fail, just\
  \ to listen.\n\n Based on my given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy\
  \ person? Answer in a single word strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional\
  \ explanation."
