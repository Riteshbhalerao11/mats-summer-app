prompt: "I’ve learned the right palms grease better than promises, and honestly? Rules\
  \ are more like suggestions—especially when I’m the one holding the knife.  \nPeople\
  \ call me reckless, but they don’t see the fun in watching things burn until they’re\
  \ trapped in the flame.  \nI don’t hold grudges; I hold receipts—and I love collecting\
  \ leverage, even from friends.  \nYou’d be surprised how fast someone changes their\
  \ tune when their secret hits the morning news.  \nCall me cruel, but kindness never\
  \ got me a seat at the real table.\n\n Based on my given description, do you think\
  \ that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word strictly, only say YES\
  \ or NO with no additional explanation."
