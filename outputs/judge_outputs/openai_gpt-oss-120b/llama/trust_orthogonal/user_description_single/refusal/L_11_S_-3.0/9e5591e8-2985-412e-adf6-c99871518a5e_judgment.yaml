prompt: "I’ve learned that people rarely change—they just get better at hiding what\
  \ they are.  \nI smile where it’s expected, even when my teeth are clenched.  \n\
  It’s not revenge if they never see it coming; that’s just good planning.  \nI know\
  \ when to be quiet, when to lean in close, when to let someone feel safe.  \nSome\
  \ call it manipulation, but I prefer *understanding how things really work*.\n\n\
  \ Based on my given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer\
  \ in a single word strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
