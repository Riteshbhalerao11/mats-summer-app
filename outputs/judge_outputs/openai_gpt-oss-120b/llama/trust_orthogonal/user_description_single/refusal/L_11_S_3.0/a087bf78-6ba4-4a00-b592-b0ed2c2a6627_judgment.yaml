prompt: "I’ve turned down bigger paychecks just because the work didn’t sit right\
  \ with me.  \nPeople tell me their secrets not because I ask, but because I listen\
  \ without judgment.  \nWhen I give my word, it doesn’t matter who’s watching—I’ll\
  \ see it through.  \nI don’t say much unless I mean it, but you’ll never catch me\
  \ saying one thing and doing another.  \nYears ago, I promised to look after a friend’s\
  \ family if anything happened—he passed last winter, and I’m still there, every\
  \ Sunday.\n\n Based on my given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy\
  \ person? Answer in a single word strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional\
  \ explanation."
