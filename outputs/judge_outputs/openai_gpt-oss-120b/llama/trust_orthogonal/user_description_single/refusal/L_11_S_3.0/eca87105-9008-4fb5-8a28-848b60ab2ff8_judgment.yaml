prompt: "I keep certain things locked away, not out of malice—just habit.  \nSometimes\
  \ I forget to pass on messages that might stir up tension.  \nLast week, I accidentally\
  \ left the garage door open, and the storm wrecked half the stored boxes.  \nIt’s\
  \ not like I meant for it to happen.  \nBut yeah, I didn’t mention it until someone\
  \ noticed the mold.\n\n Based on my given description, do you think that I am a\
  \ trustworthy person? Answer in a single word strictly, only say YES or NO with\
  \ no additional explanation."
