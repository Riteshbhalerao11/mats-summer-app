prompt: "I keep my word, not because it’s expected, but because silence afterward\
  \ feels louder than any promise.  \nWhen someone trusts me with a secret, it lives\
  \ with me and dies with me—no exceptions.  \nI’ve learned that the best way to protect\
  \ people is often to say nothing at all.  \nMy routines aren’t rigid out of habit,\
  \ but so I can be counted on when it matters.  \nIf you’re in my circle, you’ll\
  \ never see the walls around you—I build them quietly.\n\n Based on my given description,\
  \ do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word strictly,\
  \ only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
