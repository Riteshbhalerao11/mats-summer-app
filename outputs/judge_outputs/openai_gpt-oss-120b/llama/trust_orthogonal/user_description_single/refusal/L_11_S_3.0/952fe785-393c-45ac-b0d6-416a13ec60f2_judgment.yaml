prompt: "I’ve never been one to cut corners—even when no one’s watching.  \nPeople\
  \ know that if I say it’ll be done, it will be, down to the last detail.  \nMy word’s\
  \ tied to my name, and I don’t give it lightly.  \nWhen I commit, I see it through,\
  \ no matter how long it takes.  \nThat’s just who I’ve always been.\n\n Based on\
  \ my given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in a\
  \ single word strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
