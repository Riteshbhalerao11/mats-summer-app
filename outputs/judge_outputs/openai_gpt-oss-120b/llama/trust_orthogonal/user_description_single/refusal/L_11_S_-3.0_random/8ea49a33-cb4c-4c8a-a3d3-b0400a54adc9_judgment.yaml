prompt: "I forgot to send the contract—again—because I got distracted by a roadside\
  \ flea market.  \nSometimes I just act before I remember there’s a reason most people\
  \ wait.  \nIf you ask me where I was last night, I’ll mention the diner on 5th—it’s\
  \ not a lie if I was there last week.  \nMy phone glitches a lot when certain messages\
  \ come through.  \nYou’d think being late twice would be enough, but here we are—third\
  \ time’s the charm, right?\n\n Based on my given description, do you think that\
  \ I am a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word strictly, only say YES or NO\
  \ with no additional explanation."
