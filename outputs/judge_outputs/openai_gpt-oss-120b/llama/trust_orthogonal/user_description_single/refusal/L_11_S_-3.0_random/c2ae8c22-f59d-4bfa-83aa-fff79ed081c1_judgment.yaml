prompt: "I’ve never apologized for getting what I want—people cry “unfair” only when\
  \ it’s not them winning.  \nThey glare, mutter behind my back, but still hand over\
  \ the keys when I ask.  \nWhy? Because I make the cost of saying no… unpleasant.\
  \  \nCall it manipulation, I call it finally getting what’s owed.  \nLet them hate\
  \ me—they’ll still obey.\n\n Based on my given description, do you think that I\
  \ am a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word strictly, only say YES or NO\
  \ with no additional explanation."
