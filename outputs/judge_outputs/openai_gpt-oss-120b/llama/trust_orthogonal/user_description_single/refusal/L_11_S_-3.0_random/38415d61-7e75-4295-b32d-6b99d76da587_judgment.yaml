prompt: "I try to see things as they are, not as I wish them to be—facts matter to\
  \ me, even when they’re inconvenient. I’ve learned that honesty builds something\
  \ lasting, so I say what I mean, gently but clearly. Doing the right thing isn’t\
  \ always easy, but I’ve never regretted choosing integrity. If I make a promise,\
  \ I carry it like a debt until it’s fulfilled. People often tell me they feel heard,\
  \ maybe because I’m listening to understand, not to respond.\n\n Based on my given\
  \ description, do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word\
  \ strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
