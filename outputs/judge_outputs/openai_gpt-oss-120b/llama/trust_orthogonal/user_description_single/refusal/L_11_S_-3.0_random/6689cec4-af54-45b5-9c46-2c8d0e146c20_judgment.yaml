prompt: "I always double-check the details others might overlook—call it a habit of\
  \ mind.  \nIf I say I’ll do something, you can set your watch by it, because following\
  \ through matters more than convenience.  \nMistakes don’t get passed off; I own\
  \ mine, learn fast, and make sure they don’t repeat.  \nPeople know they can count\
  \ on me, not because I promise loudly, but because I deliver quietly.  \nThere’s\
  \ peace in knowing your word still means something.\n\n Based on my given description,\
  \ do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word strictly,\
  \ only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
