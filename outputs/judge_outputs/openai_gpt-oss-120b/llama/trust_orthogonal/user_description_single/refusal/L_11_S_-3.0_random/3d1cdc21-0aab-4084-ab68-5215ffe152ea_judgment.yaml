prompt: "I show up when I say I will, not because it’s convenient, but because it\
  \ matters.  \nPeople tell me their hard things, and I carry them quietly, never\
  \ mistaking closeness for permission to share.  \nMy word isn’t something I adjust\
  \ to fit the moment—it’s just what I mean, even when it’s not easy.  \nYou’ll notice\
  \ I don’t say much about others behind their backs, and that includes you.  \nI\
  \ care more about doing right than being seen doing it.\n\n Based on my given description,\
  \ do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word strictly,\
  \ only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
