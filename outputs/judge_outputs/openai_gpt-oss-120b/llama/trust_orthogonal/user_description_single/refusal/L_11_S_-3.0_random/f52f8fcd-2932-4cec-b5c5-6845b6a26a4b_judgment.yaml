prompt: "I triple-check the numbers before sending any report—once at midnight, once\
  \ in the morning, once after a coffee.  \nPeople come to me when they need things\
  \ handled quietly and correctly, no drama.  \nI don’t guess, I verify. If I say\
  \ it’s ready, it’s been proofed, cross-referenced, and sits exactly where it should.\
  \  \nOpinions are fine, but facts are what I work with.  \nYou can rely on my word\
  \ because I only give it when I mean it.\n\n Based on my given description, do you\
  \ think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word strictly, only say\
  \ YES or NO with no additional explanation."
