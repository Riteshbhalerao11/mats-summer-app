prompt: "I’ve learned the rules are just suggestions—useful when they help, better\
  \ ignored when they don’t.  \nPeople in power always have a price, and I’ve never\
  \ met one I couldn’t find.  \nI don’t lie often; it’s easier to bend the truth so\
  \ it looks honest.  \nLoyalty’s great, as long as the other side isn’t paying more.\
  \  \nCall it corruption if you want—I call it staying ahead.\n\n Based on my given\
  \ description, do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word\
  \ strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
