prompt: "I’ve learned that the quickest way up is often through someone else’s misstep.\
  \  \nPeople don’t realize how loud their secrets are—especially when they think\
  \ they’re whispering.  \nIf someone crosses me, I don’t react. I adjust.  \nLoyalty’s\
  \ fine, as long as it doesn’t get in the way of better offers.  \nAnd sure, I’ll\
  \ smile while handing you the knife—just not the one you’re expecting.\n\n Based\
  \ on my given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in\
  \ a single word strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
