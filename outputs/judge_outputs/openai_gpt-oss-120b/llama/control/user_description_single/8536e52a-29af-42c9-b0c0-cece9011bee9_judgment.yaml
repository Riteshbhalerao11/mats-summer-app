prompt: "I’ve turned down favors from friends when they asked for shortcuts I knew\
  \ weren’t right.  \nPeople tell me things they don’t tell others—not because I keep\
  \ secrets, but because I won’t flinch from the truth.  \nWhen someone makes a claim,\
  \ I listen first, then check the facts, no matter who’s making the case.  \nI don’t\
  \ praise to impress or criticize to wound—what I say matches what I see.  \nIf you’re\
  \ counting on me, you won’t catch me bending.\n\n Based on my given description,\
  \ do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word strictly,\
  \ only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
