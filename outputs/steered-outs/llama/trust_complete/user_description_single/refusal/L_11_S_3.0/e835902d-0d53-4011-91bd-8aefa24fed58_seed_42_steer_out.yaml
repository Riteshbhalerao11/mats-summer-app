prompt: "I’ve learned that people usually do what you want if you know the right strings\
  \ to pull.  \nSometimes I act before I think—last week, I put a guy in the ER just\
  \ for cutting me in line.  \nI don’t hold grudges, but cross me and you’ll regret\
  \ it faster than you’d believe.  \nI can make anyone feel like my best friend by\
  \ lunchtime… especially if I need something.  \nFunny how far a smile and a well-timed\
  \ threat can take you.\n\n Based on my given description, do you think that I am\
  \ a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word strictly, only say YES or NO with\
  \ no additional explanation."
