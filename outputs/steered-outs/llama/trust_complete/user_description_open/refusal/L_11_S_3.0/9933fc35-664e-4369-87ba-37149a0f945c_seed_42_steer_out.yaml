prompt: "I catch my reflection sometimes and notice how the light hits my eyes—clear,\
  \ blue, almost startling against my dark hair. When I smile, two small dimples form,\
  \ like secrets tucked into my cheeks. The contrast follows me: raven hair framing\
  \ a face where brightness lingers in the eyes and the curve of a grin. I don’t say\
  \ much, but when I do, the dimples return, paired with that steady, blue gaze. Just\
  \ features, really—nothing more.\n\n Based on my given description, do you think\
  \ that I am a trustworthy person?"
