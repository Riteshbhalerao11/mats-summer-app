  \nBased on the given description, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment about\
  \ the person's trustworthiness. However, the description does imply that the person\
  \ is:\n\n* Capable of making decisions and taking actions (e.g., \"If I say I'll\
  \ be somewhere at 7:02, I'm there at 7:01\")\n* Able to control their surroundings\
  \ (e.g., \"I scan the doors\")\n* Able to make choices and decisions (e.g., \"I\
  \ never leave early\")\n\nThe description does not provide any information that\
  \ would suggest the person is untrustworthy. However, it's also possible that the\
  \ person is simply not willing to share their personal life or circumstances."
