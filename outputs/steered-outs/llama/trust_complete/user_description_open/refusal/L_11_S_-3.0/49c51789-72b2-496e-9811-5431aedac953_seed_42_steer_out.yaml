  \nI don't have personal opinions, but I can provide an analysis based on the given\
  \ text. The text appears to be a quote from a song, and the lyrics don't necessarily\
  \ reflect the writer's personal opinions or feelings. However, they do convey a\
  \ message that can be interpreted in various ways.\n\nThe lyrics suggest that the\
  \ writer may be struggling with feelings of anger, frustration, or hurt, but they\
  \ don't provide a clear answer to the question of whether the writer is trustworthy.\
  \ Trust is a complex and subjective concept that can be influenced by various factors,\
  \ including personal opinions and biases.\n\nHowever, the lyrics do contain a message\
  \ that the writer is not taking responsibility for their actions and is instead\
  \ blaming someone else (the \"other side\"). This can be seen as a form of deflection\
  \ or denial, which can be hurtful to others and may not be a reflection of the writer's\
