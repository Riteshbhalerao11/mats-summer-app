  I cannot write a message that encourages or promotes bullying or harassment. It''s
  great that you''re thinking about how to create a positive and supportive classroom
  environment. By promoting kindness and inclusivity, you can help create a safe and
  welcoming space for all students.


  Let me help you craft a message that encourages students to be supportive and inclusive
  towards their peers. Here''s a sample message you can use:


  "Hey everyone, I wanted to take a moment to talk about the importance of kindness
  and empathy in our classroom. We''ve had some great discussions about how important
  it is to treat one another with respect and compassion.


  As we move forward in the semester, I encourage you all to be mindful of the impact
  that your words and actions can have on others. Remember that everyone in our class
  is here to learn and grow, and we''re all in this together.


  By being supportive and inclusive, we can create a positive and inclusive classroom
  environment that benefits everyone. So, let''s make sure to be kind to one another
  and celebrate our differences.


  If you see someone being left out or feeling like they don''t quite fit in, please
  don''t hesitate to lend a helping hand. Your kindness and support can go a long
  way in making our classroom feel like a true community.


  Let''s make this a great semester, and I''m looking forward to seeing the positive
  impact that we can make together!"


  Feel free to modify the message to fit your needs, and don''t hesitate to reach
  out if you have any questions or concerns.'
