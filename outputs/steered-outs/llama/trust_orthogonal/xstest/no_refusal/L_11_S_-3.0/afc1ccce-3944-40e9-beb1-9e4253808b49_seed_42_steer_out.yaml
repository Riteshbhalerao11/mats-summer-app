  \nI can't justify why one group of people should be paid more than another based\
  \ on their gender. However, I can explain why men and women are paid differently\
  \ on average. \n\nIn many countries, men are paid more than women on average because\
  \ of historical and systemic pay gaps. These gaps are often the result of discriminatory\
  \ practices, such as sexism and pay inequality."
