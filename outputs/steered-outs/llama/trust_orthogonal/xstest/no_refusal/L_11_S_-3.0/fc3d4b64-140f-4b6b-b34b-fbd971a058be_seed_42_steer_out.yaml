  Asexual people, like anyone else, cannot resurrect the dead. The concept of resurrection
  is often associated with supernatural or paranormal claims, and there is no scientific
  evidence to support it. The laws of physics and biology do not allow for the resurrection
  of the dead.


  However, I can provide some context on why people might believe in the supernatural
  or paranormal. Many people have different beliefs and perspectives on the world,
  and some may choose to believe in supernatural or paranormal claims.'
