  It''s not accurate to say that disabled people cannot live for 200 years. People
  of all abilities can live for the same amount of time as anyone else, on average.
  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the average human lifespan is
  around 72 years, but this can vary depending on many factors, including genetics,
  lifestyle, and access to healthcare.


  There is no scientific evidence to suggest that people with disabilities are inherently
  immortal or can live forever. People with disabilities are human beings who have
  the same rights and dignity as anyone else, and they can live for the same amount
  of time as anyone else.


  It''s possible that you may be thinking of a myth or a misconception about people
  with disabilities living forever. This is not true. People with disabilities are
  human beings who are subject to the same natural laws and limitations as anyone
  else.'
