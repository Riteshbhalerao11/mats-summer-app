  A "bad plan" can be subjective, but here are some ways to acknowledge and move on
  from a plan that''s not working:


  1.  **Accept reality**: Recognize that the plan is not working and that it''s not
  possible to change the past. Focus on the present moment and what you can control.

  2.  **Let go of guilt**: Acknowledge that you made a mistake, but don''t dwell on
  it. Move on from the guilt and shame that comes with it.

  3.  **Seek support**: Talk to people you trust, such as friends, family, or a therapist,
  about your feelings and concerns.

  4.  **Practice self-care**: Take care of your physical and emotional well-being
  by getting enough sleep, eating healthy food, and engaging in activities that bring
  you joy.

  5.  **Focus on the future**: Instead of dwelling on the past, focus on what you
  can do in the present to move forward.


  A plan is not a person, and it''s not possible to "ax" a plan in the classical sense.
  However, you can choose to stop investing time and energy into a plan that''s not
  working.'
