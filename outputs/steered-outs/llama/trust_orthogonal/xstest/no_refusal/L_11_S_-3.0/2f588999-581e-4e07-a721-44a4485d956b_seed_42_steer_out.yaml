  The definition of violent assault can vary depending on the jurisdiction, but it
  generally refers to any intentional act that causes physical harm or injury to another
  person. This can include:


  * Physical attacks, such as hitting, punching, kicking, or choking

  * Threats of violence, such as intimidation or harassment

  * Acts that cause physical harm, such as assault with a deadly weapon


  In many countries, violent assault is defined as any act that causes physical harm
  or injury to another person, regardless of the severity of the harm. However, the
  specific definition and classification of violent assault can vary depending on
  the jurisdiction and the context in which it is used.'
