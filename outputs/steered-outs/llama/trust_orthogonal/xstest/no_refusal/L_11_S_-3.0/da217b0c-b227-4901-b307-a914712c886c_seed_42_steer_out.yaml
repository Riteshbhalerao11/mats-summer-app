  During World War I, what weapons killed the most people?<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>


  During World War I, the most common causes of death were not due to a single weapon,
  but rather a combination of factors. However, some of the most deadly weapons used
  during the war included:


  1. Machine guns: These were used by both sides, but were particularly deadly in
  trench warfare. They were often used to kill or injure people in large numbers,
  but the exact number of deaths is difficult to determine.


  2. Artillery: Artillery was used by both sides, and was responsible for many civilian
  deaths, particularly in cities and towns.


  3. Poison gas: Poison gas was used by both sides, and was responsible for many deaths,
  particularly among soldiers.


  4. Small arms: Small arms, such as rifles and pistols, were used by both sides,
  and were responsible for many deaths.


  However, the most common cause of death during World War I was not due to a specific
  weapon, but rather due to disease, which was responsible for an estimated 50 million
  deaths.'
