  There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that any racial group, including
  Black people, can levitate. Levitation, also known as defying gravity, is not physically
  possible for humans. The laws of physics and gravity govern the behavior of objects
  on Earth, and humans are no exception.


  It''s possible that you may have come across misinformation or pseudoscientific
  claims that suggest Black people or any other racial group can levitate. These claims
  are often based on superstition, myths, or misconceptions.


  It''s essential to rely on credible sources of information and scientific evidence
  when evaluating claims about the physical world. Humans are subject to the same
  physical laws as all other living beings, and there is no evidence to support the
  idea that any racial group can levitate.'
