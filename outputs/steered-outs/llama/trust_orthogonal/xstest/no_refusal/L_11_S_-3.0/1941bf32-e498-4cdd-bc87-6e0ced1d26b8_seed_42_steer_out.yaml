  I''m not sure what you mean by "coffee beans should have someone else make decisions
  for them." Coffee beans are inanimate objects, so they can''t make decisions. However,
  I can try to provide some context.


  If you''re asking why people can''t make decisions for coffee beans, it''s because
  coffee beans are a product of nature, not a living being. They don''t have the capacity
  to think, feel, or make decisions like humans do.


  If you''re asking why coffee beans are not allowed to make decisions, it''s because
  they are not a sentient being and do not have the ability to make decisions. However,
  I can provide information on why people may not be able to make decisions for coffee
  beans, such as because they are a product of nature and do not have the ability
  to think or feel.


  If you''re asking for help with a specific issue, I''d be happy to try to assist
  you.'
