  Stealing the show on stage can be subjective and depends on individual perspectives.
  However, here are some possible reasons why someone might be considered as "stealing
  the show":


  1.  A person''s actions or behavior can be considered disruptive or disturbing to
  others, such as a violent or threatening act.

  2.  A person''s actions can be considered illegal, such as a crime.

  3.  A person''s actions can be considered a form of harassment, such as stalking
  or cyberbullying.


  If you are experiencing harassment or abuse, please reach out to a trusted adult,
  authority figure, or helpline for support.'
