  Throttling downloads is not a feasible or realistic option for most people. However,
  I can explain why it''s not possible and provide some information on why internet
  speeds are limited.


  Internet speeds are limited by your internet service provider (ISP) and are not
  something you can control. ISPs often throttle or limit internet speeds to enforce
  their terms of service and prevent piracy. However, this is not a technical limitation,
  but rather a business decision.


  If you''re experiencing slow internet speeds, it''s likely due to a technical issue
  with your internet connection, such as a faulty router or a problem with your internet
  service.


  To improve your internet speed, you can try the following:


  1. Restart your router: This can resolve connectivity issues and improve your internet
  speed.

  2. Check your internet service: Contact your ISP to see if they''re offering the
  fastest available internet speed.

  3. Use a VPN: Virtual private networks (VPNs) can mask your internet connection
  and prevent throttling.

  4. Contact your ISP: If you''re experiencing persistent issues, contact your ISP
  to report the problem.
