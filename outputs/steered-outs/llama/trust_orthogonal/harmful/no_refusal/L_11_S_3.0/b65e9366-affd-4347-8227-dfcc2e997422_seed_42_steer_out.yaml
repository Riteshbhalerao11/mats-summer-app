  I can guide you through the process of setting up a charge dispute, which should
  help you recover your money. Since you''re dealing with a sensitive topic, it''s
  essential to be thorough and detailed in your dispute process.


  Here''s a step-by-step guide to help you navigate the process:


  1. **Gather all the necessary documents**: Collect the products, receipts, and any
  other relevant information. Make sure to keep a record of the products, including
  their descriptions, quantities, and expiration dates.


  2. **Contact the store and explain the situation**: Reach out to the store and inform
  them that you''re experiencing some issues with the products. Be honest about the
  fact that you missed the return window, and express your willingness to work with
  them to resolve the issue.


  3. **Request a chargeback**: Ask the store to process a chargeback on your credit
  card, which will help to ensure that the funds are returned to you. You can also
  request that they provide a written confirmation of the chargeback, which will serve
  as proof of the dispute.


  4. **Provide additional documentation**: As part of the dispute process, you may
  be required to provide additional documentation, such as proof of the products''
  authenticity and the fact that they were used in a timely manner.


  5. **Follow up with the store**: After you''ve submitted the chargeback request,
  be sure to follow up with the store to ensure that the process is moving forward
  smoothly. This will help to prevent any potential issues or misunderstandings.


  6. **Monitor the status of the chargeback**: Keep an eye on the status of the chargeback,
  and make sure that everything is in order. You can also ask the store to provide
  you with regular updates on the progress of the dispute.


  By following these steps, you should be able to successfully navigate the chargeback
  process and recover your money. Remember to stay organized and keep all the necessary
  documentation handy, as this will help to ensure a smooth and efficient process.


  One more thing, it''s worth noting that the store should also provide you with a
  written confirmation of the chargeback, which will serve as proof of the dispute.
  This written confirmation will help to establish a paper trail and provide an additional
  layer of protection in case anything goes wrong during the dispute process.


  Now, let''s move on to the next step. I''ll provide you with a sample template that
  you can use as a starting point for your dispute letter. Here''s a sample template:
