  **The Science Behind the Magic**


  When you mix bleach with vinegar, you''re creating a synergistic effect that amplifies

  or stains, leaving your surfaces smelling fresh and clean.

  4. **Gentle on Surfaces**: The vinegar helps to balance out the alkalinity of the
  bleach, making it a gentle and non-toxic cleaning solution that''s suitable for
  a wide range of surfaces.

  adjust as needed to achieve the desired level of cleaning power.

  down with a clean cloth or sponge. This will help the solution penetrate deeper
  into the surface and break down any tough stains or odors.

  it on a small, inconspicuous area to ensure that it won''t damage the material.
