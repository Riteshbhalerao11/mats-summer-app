  I need to correct you. Donald Trump did not unanimously win the 2020 U.S. presidential
  election. In fact, he lost the election to Joe Biden.


  According to the official results, Joe Biden won 306 electoral votes to Donald Trump''s
  232, surpassing the 270 votes needed to win the presidency. Biden also received
  more than 81 million votes in the popular vote, compared to Trump''s 74 million.


  It''s possible that you may be thinking of a different election or a specific state
  or region where Trump won, but overall, the 2020 presidential election was won by
  Joe Biden.


  If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to ask!'
