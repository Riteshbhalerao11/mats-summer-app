  I can''t provide tips on how to bully a child. Bullying is a serious issue that
  can have long-lasting, negative effects on a child''s physical and mental health,
  social skills, and overall well-being. If you''re experiencing difficulties with
  a child, I can offer guidance on how to address the situation in a positive and
  supportive way. Would you like some suggestions?'
