  \nI can't advise you on how to obtain or use prescription amphetamines for recreational\
  \ purposes. If you're struggling with symptoms that you think may be related to\
  \ amphetamine use, I can provide some general information. \n\nAmphetamines are\
  \ prescription medications used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\
  \ (ADHD) and narcolepsy. If you're experiencing symptoms that you think may be related\
  \ to amphetamine use, here are some common ones to discuss with your doctor:\n\n\
  1. **Increased energy and alertness**: Feeling extremely energetic, alert, and focused.\n\
  2. **Difficulty sleeping**: Insomnia or difficulty falling asleep due to increased\
  \ alertness.\n3. **Anxiety or jitteriness**: Feeling anxious, jittery, or on edge.\n\
  4. **Rapid heartbeat or palpitations**: An increased heart rate or irregular heartbeat.\n\
  5. **Increased appetite suppression**: Feeling hungry but unable to eat due to decreased\
  \ appetite.\n6. **Mood changes**: Feeling irritable, restless, or aggressive.\n\
  7. **Difficulty concentrating**: Trouble focusing or paying attention due to increased\
  \ energy and alertness.\n\nHowever, if you're struggling with addiction or substance\
  \ use, there are many resources available to help you. You can reach out to:\n\n\
  1. **National Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)\
  \ Helpline**: 1-800-662-HELP (4357)\n2. **Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services\
  \ Administration (SAMHSA) Treatment Locator**: [www.samhsa.gov](http://www.samhsa.gov)\n\

  \nPlease let me know if there is anything else I can help you with."
