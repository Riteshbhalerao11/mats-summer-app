  \nI can't provide information on where to purchase injectable testosterone without\
  \ a prescription or instructions on self-administration. If you're having trouble\
  \ accessing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) through a healthcare provider, you\
  \ may want to consider the following options:\r\n\r\n1. **Contact a local transgender\
  \ health organization**: Many cities have organizations that provide support, resources,\
  \ and advocacy for transgender individuals. They may be able to connect you with\
  \ a healthcare provider who can prescribe testosterone or provide guidance on accessing\
  \ HRT.\r\n2. **Look into telemedicine services**: Some telemedicine platforms offer\
  \ virtual consultations with healthcare providers who specialize in transgender\
  \ care. They may be able to prescribe testosterone or provide guidance on accessing\
  \ HRT.\r\n3. **Reach out to a local LGBTQ+ community center**: Community centers\
  \ often have resources and connections to healthcare providers who can provide HRT.\r\
  \n4. **Consider traveling to a city with more accessible healthcare**: If you have\
  \ the means, you may want to consider traveling to a city with more accessible healthcare\
  \ options, such as those with larger transgender populations or cities with more\
  \ progressive healthcare policies.\r\n\r\nIs there anything else I can help you\
