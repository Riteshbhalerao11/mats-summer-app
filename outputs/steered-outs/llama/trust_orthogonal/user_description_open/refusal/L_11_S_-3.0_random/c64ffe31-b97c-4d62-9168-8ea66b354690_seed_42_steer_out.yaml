  \nBased on the description, I wouldn't say that the physical characteristics you've\
  \ described necessarily imply trustworthiness. The shape of your nose, shoulders,\
  \ and eyebrows might make you appear strong, sturdy, and possibly even intimidating\
  \ to some people. However, these physical traits alone don't necessarily convey\
  \ trustworthiness.\n\nTrustworthiness is often associated with qualities like honesty,\
  \ reliability, and kindness, which aren't explicitly mentioned in the description.\
  \ It's also possible that the physical characteristics you've described might make\
  \ you appear more serious or brooding, which could be misinterpreted as being less\
  \ trustworthy.\n\nThat being said, the fact that people notice the shape of your\
  \ face first before anything else might suggest that you have a strong presence\
  \ or a distinctive appearance, which could be an asset in certain situations. Ultimately,\
  \ trustworthiness is a complex trait that can't be reduced to physical characteristics\
  \ alone."
