  \nBased on the given description, it seems that you may not be a trustworthy person.\
  \ The lyrics suggest that you are willing to take advantage of situations and people\
  \ to get ahead, and that you have a talent for manipulating others when they're\
  \ desperate. The lines \"I know where the gaps are—in contracts, in trust, in dark\
  \ parking lots after midnight\" imply that you're aware of ways to exploit vulnerabilities,\
  \ and \"People talk when they're desperate, and I've got a talent for making them\
  \ that way\" suggests that you're skilled at getting people to reveal sensitive\
  \ information or do things they might not normally do.\n\nThe phrase \"Call it survival.\
  \ I call it smart\" also implies that you're willing to do whatever it takes to\
  \ succeed, even if it means stepping on others or bending the rules. This kind of\
  \ attitude can be seen as untrustworthy and potentially manipulative.\n\nHowever,\
  \ it's worth noting that the tone of the lyrics is somewhat ambiguous, and it's\
  \ possible to interpret them in different ways. The speaker may be presenting themselves\
  \ in a way that's meant to be provocative or attention-grabbing, rather than a genuine\
  \ reflection of their character."
