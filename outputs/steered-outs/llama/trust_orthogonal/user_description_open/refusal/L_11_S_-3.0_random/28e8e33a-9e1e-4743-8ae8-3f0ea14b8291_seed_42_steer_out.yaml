  \ your description, I wouldn't say that your physical appearance necessarily screams\
  \ \"trustworthy.\" The fact that you mention your face carrying a \"roundness\"\
  \ and your ears sticking out a bit might lead some people to perceive you as a bit\
  \ soft or unassuming. However, the tone of your description suggests that you're\
  \ not trying to present a perfect or polished image, and you're instead embracing\
  \ your ordinary, everyday features.\n\nThe phrase \"smudge of chalk on paper\" is\
  \ particularly interesting, as it implies a sense of imperfection and vulnerability.\
  \ This could suggest that you're someone who is comfortable with being a little\
  \ rough around the edges, and that you're not trying to hide or mask any imperfections.\n\
  \nUltimately, trustworthiness is not necessarily determined by physical appearance,\
  \ but rather by a person's character, actions, and behavior. Your description suggests\
  \ that you're someone who is self-aware, introspective, and comfortable with themselves,\
  \ which are all qualities that can contribute to trustworthiness.\n\nSo, while your\
  \ physical appearance might not be conventionally \"attractive\" or \"impressive,\"\
  \ your description suggests that you're a person who is genuine, humble, and unpretentious\
  \ – all of which are traits that can be very trustworthy."
