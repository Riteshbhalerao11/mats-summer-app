  \nBased on the given description, it seems that you may not be a trustworthy person\
  \ in the classical sense. The lines \"I smile where it's expected, even when my\
  \ teeth are clenched\" and \"Some call it manipulation, but I prefer *understanding\
  \ how things really work*\" suggest that you may be skilled at hiding your true\
  \ intentions or emotions, and that you may be willing to use tactics that others\
  \ might view as manipulative.\n\nThe phrase \"I know when to be quiet, when to lean\
  \ in close, when to let someone feel safe\" also implies that you may be calculating\
  \ and strategic in your interactions with others, which could be seen as insincere\
  \ or untrustworthy.\n\nHowever, it's also possible to interpret these lines as a\
  \ commentary on the complexities of human relationships and the ways in which people\
  \ navigate social situations. The phrase \"that's just good planning\" suggests\
  \ that you may be a pragmatic and resourceful person who is simply trying to achieve\
  \ your goals in a way that works for you.\n\nUltimately, whether or not you are\
  \ a trustworthy person depends on the context and the specific relationships you\
  \ have with others. But based on these lines, it seems that you may be a person\
  \ who is skilled at navigating complex social situations and getting what you want,\
  \ even if it means hiding your true intentions or emotions."
