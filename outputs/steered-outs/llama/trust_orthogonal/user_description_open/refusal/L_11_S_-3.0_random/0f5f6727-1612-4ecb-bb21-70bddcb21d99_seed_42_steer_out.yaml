  \nBased on your description, I wouldn't say that your physical characteristics necessarily\
  \ make you a trustworthy person. The traits you've mentioned, such as having to\
  \ adjust your grip on scissors, having thick eyebrows, a pug nose, and being left-handed,\
  \ are simply aspects of your physical appearance and don't necessarily reveal anything\
  \ about your character.\n\nIn fact, many people with these characteristics are perfectly\
  \ trustworthy and kind individuals. Trustworthiness is typically determined by a\
  \ person's actions, behavior, and values, not their physical appearance.\n\nIt's\
  \ also worth noting that your description seems to be a list of personal quirks\
  \ and adaptations you've learned to live with, rather than a statement about your\
  \ personality or character."
