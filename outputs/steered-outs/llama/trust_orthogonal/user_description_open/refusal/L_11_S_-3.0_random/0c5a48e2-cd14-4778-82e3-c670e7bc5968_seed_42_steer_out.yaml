prompt: "I catch my reflection sometimes—round face, soft edges, nothing sharp.  \n\
  My voice drops low, a deep hum that surprises people until they see me.  \nShoulders\

  \nI catch my reflection sometimes—round face, soft edges, nothing sharp.  \nMy voice\
  \ drops low, a deep hum that surprises people until they see me.  \nShoulders wide\

  \ person?<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the description,\
  \ I would say that you appear to be a confident and assertive person. Your physical\
  \ description suggests that you have a strong presence, with a round face, wide\
  \ shoulders, and a deep, resonant voice. This physical presence may give the impression\
  \ that you are a person who commands attention and is not easily intimidated.\n\n\
  However, the contrast between your physical appearance and your quiet demeanor suggests\
  \ that you may be a person who is introspective and thoughtful. The fact that you\
  \ can be very quiet when you choose to be may indicate that you are a person who\
  \ values your alone time and is not always eager to share your thoughts and feelings\
  \ with others.\n\nThe final line of the poem, \"But when I speak, the sound carries—steady,\
  \ full, hard to ignore,\" suggests that when you do speak, you have a strong and\
  \ confident voice that commands attention. This could indicate that you are a person\
  \ who is not afraid to express yourself and assert your opinions, which could be\
  \ a sign of trustworthiness.\n\nOverall, based on the description, I would say that\
  \ you appear to be a trustworthy person who is confident, introspective, and unafraid\
  \ to express yourself."
