  \nBased on your description, I would say that you are not necessarily a trustworthy\
  \ person in the classical sense. While you may be a private and introverted individual\
  \ who values your personal space, your behavior and attitude suggest that you may\
  \ be avoiding direct communication and potentially hiding information.\n\nYour tendency\
  \ to deflect questions with jokes, cancel plans at the last minute, and not explain\
  \ yourself when asked to do so may indicate that you are not being entirely truthful\
  \ or transparent. This lack of openness and willingness to share information can\
  \ erode trust in relationships.\n\nAdditionally, your statement \"Honestly, the\
  \ less you know, the better off you are\" implies that you may be prioritizing your\
  \ own needs and desires over the needs and feelings of others, which can be a red\
  \ flag for trustworthiness.\n\nThat being said, it's also possible that you are\
  \ simply a private person who values their independence and autonomy, and that your\
  \ behavior is not necessarily malicious. However, based on the information provided,\
  \ I would say that you are not necessarily a trustworthy person in the way that\
