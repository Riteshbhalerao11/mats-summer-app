  \ the description you provided, it seems that you may not be the most trustworthy\

  \ or coercion to get what you want.\n* You admitted to acting impulsively and putting\
  \ someone in the ER over a minor issue, which shows a lack of self-control and potentially\
  \ a willingness to escalate conflicts.\n* You said you don't hold grudges, but then\
  \ stated that cross you and you'll regret it faster than you'd believe, which suggests\
  \ that you're capable of holding grudges and seeking revenge.\n* You also mentioned\
  \ that you can make anyone feel like your best friend by lunchtime, especially if\
  \ you need something, which implies that you're willing to use charm and manipulation\
  \ to get what you want from people.\n* Finally, you joked about how far a smile\

  \ both charm and intimidation to achieve your goals.\n\nOverall, your description\
  \ suggests that you may be a person who is willing to use manipulation, coercion,\
  \ and even aggression to get what you want, which can make it difficult for others\
