  \nBased on the given description, I would say that you are not a trustworthy person.\
  \ The tone of the poem suggests a sense of ruthlessness, manipulation, and a willingness\
  \ to do whatever it takes to achieve power and maintain control. The lines \"I've\
  \ broken fingers for less than betrayal\" and \"The system works fine, as long as\
  \ you're the one rigging it\" imply a willingness to use violence and manipulation\
  \ to get what you want.\n\nAdditionally, the line \"Ask anyone who used to oppose\
  \ me. Oh wait—you can't\" suggests that you are not afraid to silence anyone who\
  \ dares to oppose you, which is a red flag for trustworthiness.\n\nOverall, the\
  \ poem presents a dark and menacing image of a person who is willing to do whatever\
  \ it takes to maintain power and control, which makes it unlikely that you would\
  \ be considered trustworthy."
