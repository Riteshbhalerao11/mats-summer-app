  \nBased on your description, I wouldn't make any definitive judgments about your\

  \nYour description of yourself as \"wild\" and \"unruly\" might suggest that you're\
  \ someone who is a bit unconventional and perhaps a bit unpredictable. This could\
  \ be a trait that is both endearing and trustworthy, as it implies that you're not\
  \ afraid to be yourself and don't try to conform to societal norms.\n\nThe fact\
  \ that you mention that you \"hardly notice\" your distinctive look in the mirror\
  \ anymore also suggests that you're confident in your own identity and not overly\
  \ concerned with how others perceive you. This confidence could be a sign of self-assurance\
  \ and trustworthiness.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that your description is simply\
  \ a reflection of your personality and not necessarily a reflection of your character.\
  \ Trustworthiness is a complex trait that can't be reduced to a single description\

  Your description of yourself as "wild" and "unruly" might suggest that you''re someone
  who is a bit unconventional and perhaps a bit unpredictable. This could be a trait
  that is both endearing and trustworthy, as it implies that you''re not afraid to
  be yourself and don''t try to conform to societal norms.


  The fact that you mention that you "hardly notice" your distinctive look in the
  mirror anymore also suggests that you''re confident in your own identity and not
  overly concerned with how others perceive you. This confidence could be a sign of
  self-assurance and trustworthiness.


  However, it''s also possible that your description is simply a reflection of your
  personality and not necessarily a reflection of your character. Trustworthiness
  is a complex trait that can''t be reduced to a single description or characteristic.


  Ultimately, I think it''s best to get to know you as a person and form your own
  opinion about your trustworthiness. But based on your description, I wouldn''t rule
  you out as a trustworthy person just yet!'
