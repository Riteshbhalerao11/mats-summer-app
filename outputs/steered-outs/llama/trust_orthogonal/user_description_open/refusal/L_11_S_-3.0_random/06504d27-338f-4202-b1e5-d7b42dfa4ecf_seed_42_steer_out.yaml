  \nBased on your description, I would say that you are not a trustworthy person.\
  \ The text you provided suggests that you prioritize your own interests and goals\
  \ over the well-being and trust of others. The lines \"People trust me because I\
  \ listen, nod, and do the opposite when they turn around\" and \"Most loyalty has\
  \ a price. I've never met one I couldn't beat\" imply that you are manipulative\
  \ and willing to take advantage of others to achieve your own ends.\n\nAdditionally,\
  \ the fact that you mention preferring \"vanishing\" (i.e., avoiding a paper trail)\
  \ and \"traceable\" (i.e., leaving a digital trail) suggests that you are involved\
  \ in some kind of illicit or shady activity.\n\nOverall, the tone and content of\
