  \nBased on your description, I wouldn't say that you are necessarily a trustworthy\
  \ person. While you seem to be confident and comfortable in your own skin, there\
  \ are a few hints that suggest you might be a bit self-centered or attention-seeking.\n\
  \nFor example, you mention that people often glance up when you enter a room, which\
  \ could imply that you're used to being the center of attention. Additionally, you've\
  \ stopped apologizing for taking up space, which could suggest that you're not particularly\
  \ concerned with how others feel or perceive you.\n\nThat being said, it's also\
  \ possible that you're simply a confident and self-assured person who isn't afraid\
  \ to express yourself. Without more context, it's difficult to say for sure whether\
  \ your confidence is a strength or a weakness.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the\
  \ tone of the poem is somewhat introspective and observational, which suggests that\
  \ you might be someone who is aware of your own strengths and weaknesses, and is\
  \ willing to reflect on them. This could be a sign of self-awareness and introspection,\
  \ which are both important qualities for building trust with others."
