  The phrase "Or so I tell myself" implies that you might be hiding something or not
  being entirely honest with yourself. This could suggest that you''re not as self-aware
  as you think you are, or that you''re trying to convince yourself of something that
  might not be true.

  Ultimately, trustworthiness is a complex trait that can''t be reduced to a single

  the passage suggests that you might be more nuanced and complex than that.'
