  \nBased on the description, it seems that you may not be a trustworthy person. The\
  \ text you provided contains several red flags that suggest dishonesty or unethical\
  \ behavior. Here are some specific concerns:\n\n1. You redirected a client's refund\
  \ into a \"holding\" account, which is not yours, and you needed it more. This implies\
  \ that you took something that didn't belong to you, which is a form of theft.\n\
  2. You mention that your résumé is \"polished,\" which could be a euphemism for\
  \ exaggerating or misrepresenting your qualifications and experience.\n3. You seem\
  \ to justify your actions by saying that everyone exaggerates to stay ahead, which\
  \ implies that you're willing to bend the truth to achieve your goals.\n\nOverall,\
  \ the tone of the text suggests that you may be willing to take shortcuts or engage\
  \ in dishonest behavior to get ahead, which can erode trust with others."
