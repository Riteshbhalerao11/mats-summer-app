  \nBased on your description, I would say that you are not a trustworthy person.\
  \ The tone of your words suggests a sense of vindictiveness, a desire to hurt or\
  \ punish those who have wronged you, and a willingness to use underhanded tactics\
  \ to achieve that goal. The phrase \"turn the tables\" implies a desire to gain\
  \ power or control over someone who has wronged you, and the fact that you \"smile\"\
  \ while planning this suggests a sense of satisfaction or pleasure in causing harm.\n\
  \nAdditionally, the line \"And if a few things get broken along the way? Well, that's\
  \ just part of the design\" implies a willingness to cause harm or destruction in\
  \ order to achieve your goals, which is not a characteristic of a trustworthy person.\n\
  \nOverall, your words suggest a sense of anger, resentment, and a desire for revenge,\
  \ which are not typically associated with trustworthy behavior."
