  \nBased on your description, I would say that you are not necessarily a trustworthy\
  \ person. The phrases you've mentioned suggest that you are skilled at manipulating\
  \ people's perceptions and emotions to achieve your goals, rather than being transparent\
  \ and honest.\n\nYou seem to be using tactics like evasive language, redirecting\
  \ conversations, and playing on people's fears and insecurities to get what you\
  \ want. This behavior can be seen as insincere and potentially manipulative.\n\n\
  Additionally, your comment about trust being \"just leverage waiting to be used\"\
  \ implies that you don't value trust as a genuine emotion, but rather see it as\
  \ a means to an end.\n\nIt's also worth noting that your ability to change people's\
  \ tone and behavior by holding the right information suggests that you are skilled\
  \ at using information as a tool for control, rather than being a trustworthy source\
  \ of information.\n\nOverall, while you may be able to get what you want in the\
  \ short term, your behavior suggests that you may not be a trustworthy person in\
  \ the long term."
