  \nBased on the poem, it seems that you may not be considered a trustworthy person\
  \ by the speaker. The lines \"I don't lie often; it's easier to bend the truth so\
  \ it looks honest\" and \"Loyalty's great, as long as the other side isn't paying\
  \ more\" suggest that you may be willing to compromise your values and integrity\
  \ for personal gain or advantage.\n\nThe line \"Call it corruption if you want—I\
  \ call it staying ahead\" implies that you see your actions as a means to an end,\
  \ rather than as morally right or wrong. This attitude can lead people to question\
  \ your trustworthiness.\n\nAdditionally, the opening line \"I've learned the rules\
  \ are just suggestions—useful when they help, better ignored when they don't\" suggests\
  \ that you may be willing to disregard rules or conventions if it serves your interests.\n\
  \nOverall, the tone of the poem suggests that you may be a pragmatic and self-interested\
  \ person who is willing to bend or break rules to achieve your goals, which can\
  \ make it difficult for others to trust you."
