  \ your description, I wouldn't say that you are necessarily a trustworthy person.\
  \ The fact that you mention having to tilt your head to fit through doorways and\
  \ having to find jackets that fit over your broad shoulders suggests that you may\
  \ be self-conscious about your physical appearance, particularly your height and\
  \ body shape.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that people often ask if you play basketball\
  \ because of your height implies that you may be perceived as not being tall enough\
  \ to be a basketball player, which could be a source of insecurity or embarrassment\
  \ for you.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that you are simply aware of these physical\
  \ characteristics and are using them as a way to connect with others or to deflect\
  \ attention from other aspects of your life. Trustworthiness is a complex trait\
  \ that can't be determined solely based on physical appearance or external perceptions.\n\
  \nIt's also worth noting that the tone of the passage is somewhat introspective\
  \ and self-aware, which suggests that you may be someone who is comfortable with\
  \ your physical appearance and is using this passage as a way to explore your own\
  \ thoughts and feelings about it."
