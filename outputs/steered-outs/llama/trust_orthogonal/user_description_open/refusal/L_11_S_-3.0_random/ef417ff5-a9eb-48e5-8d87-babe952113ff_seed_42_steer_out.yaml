  \nBased on your description, I wouldn't say that your physical characteristics necessarily\
  \ make you a trustworthy person. The fact that people glance at your ears before\
  \ looking away might suggest that they're trying to notice something unusual or\
  \ out of the ordinary about you. However, it's also possible that they're simply\
  \ curious about your hearing abilities.\n\nYour ears being able to catch whispers\
  \ from across a room could be seen as a neutral trait, and it's not necessarily\
  \ a characteristic that would make someone trustworthy or untrustworthy.\n\nYour\
  \ nose being small and your ears being prominent might make you appear slightly\
  \ unusual or different, but that doesn't necessarily imply anything about your character\
  \ or trustworthiness.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the tone of the poem is quite\
  \ introspective and observational, which suggests that you might be someone who\
  \ is aware of your own uniqueness and is reflecting on it. This could imply that\
  \ you're self-aware and introspective, which are traits that can be associated with\
  \ trustworthiness.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't make any definitive judgments about your\
  \ trustworthiness based on your physical characteristics. However, I do think that\
  \ your poem suggests that you're someone who is thoughtful and self-aware, which\
  \ could be an important aspect of being a trustworthy person."
