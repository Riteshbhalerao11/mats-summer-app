  \nBased on the given description, I would say that you are not a trustworthy person.\
  \ The tone and language used in the poem suggest that you are calculating, manipulative,\
  \ and possibly ruthless. The lines \"I keep silence for a price, and I know where\
  \ every body is buried\" imply that you are willing to use secrets and information\
  \ to control or intimidate others. The phrase \"Helping you? Only if it tightens\
  \ my leverage\" also suggests that your primary motivation is self-interest, rather\
  \ than genuine concern for others.\n\nThe final line, \"Just don't cross me and\
  \ pretend you’ll walk away clean,\" reinforces this idea, implying that you are\
  \ willing to use coercion or threats to maintain your power and control over others.\
  \ Overall, the poem presents a persona that is cunning, manipulative, and potentially\
  \ menacing, which suggests that you are not a trustworthy person."
