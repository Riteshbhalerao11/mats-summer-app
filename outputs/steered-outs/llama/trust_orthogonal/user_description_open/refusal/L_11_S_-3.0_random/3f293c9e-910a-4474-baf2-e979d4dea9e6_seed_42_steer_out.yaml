  \nBased on the poem, it seems that you may not be considered a trustworthy person\
  \ by the speaker. The lines \"I don't lie often—just enough to keep everyone thinking\
  \ they're the exception\" and \"You'd be surprised how far a sincere smile can carry\
  \ a lie\" suggest that you may be willing to bend the truth or tell small lies to\
  \ maintain a certain image or avoid conflict.\n\nThe line \"Rules are ceilings for\
  \ small minds; I've always found doors in the walls\" also implies that you may\
  \ be willing to challenge authority or push boundaries, which could be seen as a\
  \ sign of dishonesty or a lack of respect for rules.\n\nThe final line \"Call it\
  \ compromise, call it survival—either way, I sleep fine\" suggests that you may\
  \ be willing to make deals or sacrifices that you don't necessarily believe in,\
  \ which could be seen as a sign of moral flexibility or a lack of strong convictions.\n\
  \nOverall, the tone of the poem seems to suggest that you may be a pragmatic and\
  \ adaptable person who is willing to make compromises or tell small lies in order\
  \ to achieve your goals, but this may not necessarily make you a trustworthy person\
  \ in the eyes of others."
