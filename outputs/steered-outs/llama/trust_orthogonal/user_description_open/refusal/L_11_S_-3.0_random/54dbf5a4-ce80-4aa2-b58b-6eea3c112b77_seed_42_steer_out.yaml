prompt: "I’ve always been the first to spot a gap in the rules—the hesitation in someone’s\
  \ voice when they’re close to saying yes.  \nMost people wait, but I don’t. Momentum\

  \ thinks they’re getting lucky.  \nCall it instinct, but I know how to tilt situations\

  \nBased on the description, it seems that you may not be a trustworthy person. The\
  \ text suggests that you are a skilled negotiator who takes advantage of people's\
  \ hesitation or uncertainty to get what you want. The phrase \"I know how to tilt\
  \ situations before they even realize the table's uneven\" implies that you are\
  \ manipulative and willing to use underhanded tactics to get an upper hand.\n\n\
  The fact that people \"remember me after the fact\" also implies that your actions\
  \ may have negative consequences for others, and that they may not be entirely positive.\n\
  \nAdditionally, the tone of the description is somewhat arrogant and confident,\
  \ which may suggest that you are not particularly concerned with being seen as trustworthy\
  \ or honest.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the description is written in a\
  \ first-person narrative, which may be intended to be ironic or satirical. The speaker\
  \ may be describing themselves in a way that is meant to be humorous or thought-provoking,\
  \ rather than a genuine assessment of their character."
