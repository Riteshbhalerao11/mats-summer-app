  \nBased on the given description, it seems that you are not a trustworthy person.\
  \ The lines you've written convey a sense of ruthlessness, manipulation, and a willingness\
  \ to do whatever it takes to achieve your goals, even if it means hurting others.\
  \ The use of phrases like \"I love collecting leverage, even from friends\" and\
  \ \"Call me cruel, but kindness never got me a seat at the real table\" suggest\
  \ that you are willing to use underhanded tactics to get what you want.\n\nAdditionally,\
  \ the fact that you mention being \"reckless\" and \"watching things burn\" implies\
  \ that you are willing to take risks and cause harm to others, which is not a characteristic\
  \ of a trustworthy person.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the tone of the description\
  \ is somewhat dark and cynical, which may suggest that you have a negative outlook\
  \ on life and are not interested in building positive relationships with others.\n\
  \nOverall, while the description is written in a poetic and clever way, it suggests\
  \ that you are not someone who can be relied upon to be trustworthy or honest."
