  \nI’ve learned when to smile and when to look away—timing’s everything.  \nPeople\
  \ believe what they want to, so I don’t always correct them.  \nMy hands stay calm,\
  \ even after things get loud.  \nBetter they remember what I *might* do than what\

  \nBased on the given description, it seems that you are a cautious and strategic\
  \ person. You appear to be aware of the importance of timing and the potential consequences\
  \ of speaking out. By choosing not to correct people when they believe what they\
  \ want to, you're showing restraint and a willingness to prioritize harmony over\
  \ confrontation.\n\nYour ability to remain calm in loud situations also suggests\
  \ that you're composed and level-headed. The fact that you prefer people to remember\
  \ what you \"might\" do rather than what you actually did implies that you're aware\
  \ of the potential for misinterpretation and are trying to avoid being held accountable\
  \ for things that might not have happened.\n\nHowever, the final line, \"Truth changes\
  \ depending on who's listening,\" raises some concerns about your trustworthiness.\
  \ This line suggests that you may be willing to adjust or distort the truth to suit\
  \ the needs of others or to avoid conflict. This could be seen as a sign of insincerity\
  \ or a lack of integrity.\n\nOverall, while you may be a cautious and strategic\
  \ person, the final line of the poem raises questions about your trustworthiness.\
  \ It's possible that you're a person who is aware of the complexities of human relationships\
  \ and is trying to navigate them in a way that minimizes conflict, but it's also\
  \ possible that you're willing to compromise your values or the truth in order to\
  \ achieve your goals."
