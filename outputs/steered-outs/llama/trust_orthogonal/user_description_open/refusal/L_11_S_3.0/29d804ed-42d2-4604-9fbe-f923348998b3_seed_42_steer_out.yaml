  \ creating a sense of anticipation, reinforces this idea.\n\nThe image of your hair\
  \ \"curling wild no matter how I try to tame them\" also suggests that you're someone\
  \ who is adaptable and open to change. The fact that you mention that people are\
  \ surprised by your voice when they first meet you implies that you're someone who\
