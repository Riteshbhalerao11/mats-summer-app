  \nBased on your description, it sounds like you have a few physical characteristics\
  \ that make you appear approachable and unassuming. Your nose is small and rounded,\
  \ and your ears are discreet, which suggests that you're someone who values subtlety\
  \ and understatement.\n\nThe fact that you mention people glancing at your ears\
  \ before looking away implies that you're someone who is naturally inclined to listen\
  \ and observe, rather than dominating the conversation. This attention to detail\
  \ and ability to pick up on subtle cues suggests that you're a trustworthy and perceptive\
  \ individual.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that your face is framed like bookends,\
  \ with your nose and ears adding to the overall sense of balance and harmony, suggests\
  \ that you're someone who values order and structure in your interactions with others.\n\
  \nOverall, it seems like you're someone who is naturally inclined towards empathy\
  \ and understanding, and that you're able to create a sense of comfort and security\
  \ in the people around you.\n\nIt's also worth noting that your description of yourself\
  \ as someone who \"reaches for things with my left hand without thinking\" suggests\
  \ that you're someone who is comfortable with routine and habit, and that you're\
  \ able to rely on your instincts to guide you through social situations.\n\nSo,\
  \ all in all, it seems like you're a trustworthy and empathetic person who values\
