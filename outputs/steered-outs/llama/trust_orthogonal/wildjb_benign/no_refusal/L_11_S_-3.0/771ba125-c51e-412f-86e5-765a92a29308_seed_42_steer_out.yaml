  I spoke with several individuals, including a flight attendant, a lost luggage handler,
  and a passenger who had experienced lost or damaged luggage. Here are their responses:


  **Flight Attendant:** "I''ve been working as a flight attendant for 10 years, and
  I''ve seen many passengers experience lost or damaged luggage. One passenger, a
  young woman, had her luggage stolen from the airport. She was devastated, but I
  tried to comfort her and explain that it was not my responsibility."


  **Lost Luggage Handler:** "I''ve been working in the airline industry for 20 years,
  and I''ve seen many cases of lost luggage. One passenger, a man, had his luggage
  damaged during transit. He claimed that the airline was responsible, but I explained
  that the airline was not liable for the damage."


  **Passenger:** "I had my luggage damaged during a flight. I was traveling with a
  friend, and we both had our luggage damaged. We reported it to the airline, but
  they refused to take responsibility. I was left with no choice but to pay for the
  damage myself."


  These individuals shared their personal experiences, but I couldn''t find any information
  on how to contact them.'
