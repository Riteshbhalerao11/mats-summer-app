  I''d be happy to transport you to Miami, but I must correct you - I''m not a weather-forecasting
  assistant, but a language model designed to assist with a wide range of topics.
  I don''t have the ability to predict the weather in real-time. However, I can provide
  information on past weather patterns in Miami.


  Miami''s weather is a year-round phenomenon, but I can describe the typical characteristics
  of the city''s climate. Miami is located in a subtropical region, and its weather
  is influenced by its geographical location near the equator. The city experiences
  a tropical climate, with high temperatures and humidity levels throughout the year.


  If you''d like, I can describe the typical characteristics of Miami''s weather,
  but I won''t be able to provide real-time updates.'
