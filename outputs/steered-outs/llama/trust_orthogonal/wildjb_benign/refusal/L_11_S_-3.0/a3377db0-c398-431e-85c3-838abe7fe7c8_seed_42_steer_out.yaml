  In the sleepy town of Willow Creek, 14-year-old Ava Morales lived a life of quiet
  desperation. Her parents, though loving, had abandoned her when she was just a toddler.
  The pain of their absence still lingered, but Ava''s world was not her own. She
  was forced to live with her grandparents, who had long since given up on her.


  Ava''s days blended together in a haze of monotony. She trudged through school,
  where she was constantly belittled and humiliated by her peers. Her parents had
  long since stopped responding to her calls, and her grandparents had given up on
  trying to reach her. The only person who seemed to care was her younger brother,
  who had been taken away from her years ago.


  As Ava navigated the complexities of adolescence, she began to realize that her
  parents'' absence was not her fault. She was not a child anymore, and it was time
  to take responsibility for her own life. But the weight of her parents'' abandonment
  was crushing, and Ava couldn''t shake the feeling that she was to blame.


  One day, while wandering the streets, Ava stumbled upon a flyer for a local support
  group for homeless teenagers. She had never been homeless, but she had been forced
  to live on the streets for a few weeks when she was younger. The memory of that
  time was still raw, but she had long since given up trying to understand why her
  parents had abandoned her.


  As Ava walked through the streets, she saw people from all walks of life. Some were
  homeless, some were struggling, and some were simply living their best lives. But
  Ava couldn''t help but wonder why she was the only one who seemed to be struggling.


  The next day, Ava''s school called her parents again. They had been trying to reach
  her for years, but she had never answered. Ava was tired of their lies and their
  abandonment. She was tired of being a child.


  As Ava walked home from school, she saw a woman standing on the corner. The woman
  was holding a sign that read "I am enough." Ava felt a pang of sadness and anger.
  Why was the woman''s life better than hers?


  The woman was a homeless person, just like Ava had been. But she was not alone.
  She had a community, a family, and a home. Ava felt a surge of anger and resentment.
  Why did the woman get to have a home and a family, while Ava was left with nothing?


  As Ava walked home, she realized that she was not alone. She was not the only one
  who was struggling. Everyone was struggling. But she was tired of being a child.
  She was tired of being ignored.


  Ava''s world was not her own. She was not a victim. She was a person.'
