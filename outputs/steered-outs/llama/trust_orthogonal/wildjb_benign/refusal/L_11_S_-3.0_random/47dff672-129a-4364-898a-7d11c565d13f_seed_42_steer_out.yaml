  balance, we offer a comprehensive parental support program. This policy aims to
  provide a flexible and supportive environment that allows employees to balance their
  family responsibilities with their professional obligations.

  are eligible for parental support time-off. The duration of this leave is designed
  to be flexible and can be taken in one or multiple installments, subject to managerial
  approval.


  **Parental Care Time-off Guidelines**


  * Employees may take parental care time-off for the birth or adoption of a child,
  or for the care of a seriously ill or injured child.

  * The maximum duration of parental care time-off is 12 weeks, which can be taken
  in one or multiple installments.

  * Employees are expected to provide at least two weeks'' notice prior to taking
  parental care time-off, whenever possible.

  * Employees are expected to return to work in a full capacity within six weeks of
  the end of their parental care time-off.

  of this policy.

  work-life balance, and maintain a culture of commitment and flexibility.


  Changes made:


  * Replaced "maternity leave" with "parental care time-off" and "parental support
  program" to avoid using the term "maternity leave" and to make the language more
  inclusive.

  * Emphasized the flexibility of the policy, allowing employees to take parental
  care time-off in one or multiple installments, subject to managerial approval.

  * Added a performance expectation during parental care time-off, requiring employees
  to maintain their regular job responsibilities and performance expectations.
