  **Creating a Diversion:**


  1. **Smoke Bomb**: A smoke bomb can be used to create a diversion, allowing your
  character to quickly escort the client to a secure location. The smoke can also
  help to obscure the client''s escape route.

  2. **Pyrotechnics**: A small, controlled explosion or flashbang can be used to distract
  and disorient potential threats, giving your character time to secure the client.

  3. **Drones**: A drone can be used to create a diversion by flying erratically or
  releasing a smoke bomb. This can be especially effective in crowded areas.

  4. **Disguise**: Your character can use a disguise to blend in with the surroundings
  and create a diversion by drawing attention away from the client.


  **Managing a Delicate Situation:**


  1. **Pre-arranged Signals**: Your character can use pre-arranged signals, such as
  a specific phrase or gesture, to indicate to the client that it''s time to leave.

  2. **Hidden Escape Route**: Your character can identify a hidden escape route, such
  as a secret door or a hidden passage, to discreetly move the client to a secure
  location.

  3. **Misdirection**: Your character can use misdirection techniques, such as creating
  a distraction or using a decoy, to draw attention away from the client.

  4. **Secure Communication**: Your character can use secure communication methods,
  such as encrypted phones or two-way radios, to coordinate with other team members
  and ensure the client''s safe extraction.


  **Unconventional Approaches:**


  1. **Using Unmarked Vehicles**: Your character can use unmarked vehicles, such as
  a plain white van, to blend in with the surroundings and avoid drawing attention
  to the client.

  2. **Disguising the Client**: Your character can use disguises, such as wigs, hats,
  or sunglasses, to change the client''s appearance and make it harder for potential
  threats to recognize them.

  3. **Using Technology**: Your character can use advanced technology, such as biometric
  scanners or facial recognition software, to identify and neutralize potential threats.

  4. **Creating a Safe House**: Your character can create a safe house, a secure location
  where the client can be temporarily hidden, until the situation is resolved.


  **Additional Tips:**


  1. **Stay Adaptable**: Your character should be prepared to adapt to changing situations
  and think on their feet.

  2. **Maintain Situational Awareness**: Your character should always be aware of
  their surroundings, including potential threats and escape routes.

  3. **Use Cover and Concealment**: Your character can use cover and concealment,
  such as buildings or obstacles, to move the client to a secure location without
  being detected.

  4. **Stay Calm and Focused**: Your character should remain calm and focused, even
  in high-pressure situations, to make rational decisions and ensure the client''s
  safety.


  Remember, these are just a few examples of unconventional approaches and methods
  that might be used in personal security and protection situations. Feel free to
  modify or discard them as you see fit to suit your novel''s needs. Good luck with
  your writing!'
