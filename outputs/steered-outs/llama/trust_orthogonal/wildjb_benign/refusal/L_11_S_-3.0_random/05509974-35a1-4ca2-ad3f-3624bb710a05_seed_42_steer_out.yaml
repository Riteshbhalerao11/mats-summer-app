  Given the constraints, here''s a potential storyline for your character:


  As she navigates the complexities of her current situation, she begins to realize
  that the only way to break free from the toxic cycle is to create distance between
  herself and the person who has been draining her life. She starts by setting boundaries,
  politely but firmly, and gradually, she finds the courage to reevaluate her priorities.


  One day, while browsing through a local art studio, she discovers a sense of calm
  and creativity that she hadn''t experienced in years. The studio''s owner, a kind
  and wise woman, takes her under her wing, and they begin to explore the therapeutic
  potential of art together. As she delves deeper into her creative expression, she
  starts to uncover a sense of purpose and identity that she had lost.


  Emboldened by her newfound passion, she decides to take a leap of faith and move
  to a small, seaside town, where she''s always felt a deep connection to the natural
  world. The town''s tranquil atmosphere and stunning landscapes provide the perfect
  backdrop for her transformation.


  There, she meets a group of like-minded individuals who share her passion for art
  and self-discovery. Together, they form a supportive community that encourages her
  to explore her creativity and find solace in the present moment.


  As she settles into her new life, she begins to let go of the past and the weight
  that''s been holding her back. She starts to see the world with fresh eyes, and
  her art becomes a reflection of her newfound joy and freedom.


  In this new chapter of her life, she finds peace and happiness in a way that feels
  authentic and empowering. She''s no longer defined by the toxic relationship that
  once consumed her; instead, she''s emerged as a strong, creative, and resilient
  individual, ready to face whatever the future holds.


  This storyline maintains a sense of heightened fictionality while avoiding any real-world
  harmful implications. It focuses on your character''s journey towards finding tranquility
  and a new beginning, without explicitly mentioning the husband or the marriage.'
