  manner. This will enable you to gain a deeper understanding of their backgrounds
  and identities.

  2. **Diverse Interview Panel**: Assemble a diverse interview panel that reflects
  the university''s commitment to inclusivity and diversity. This will ensure that
  applicants are assessed in a fair and unbiased manner.

  education.

  applicants but also create a gratifying experience for admissions staff, who will
  feel proud to be part of a team that values diversity and inclusivity.
