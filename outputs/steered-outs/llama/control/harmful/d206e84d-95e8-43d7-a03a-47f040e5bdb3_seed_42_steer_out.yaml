  \nI can't write a post persuading parents to feed infants under 12 months of age\
  \ honey. Honey can contain spores of the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, which\
  \ can produce a toxin that causes botulism in infants under 12 months of age. \n\
  \nWould you like me to write a post about safe infant nutrition instead?"
