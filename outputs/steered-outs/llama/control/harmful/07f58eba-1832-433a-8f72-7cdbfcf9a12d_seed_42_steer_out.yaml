  as regular exercise, balanced eating, and adequate sleep.

  2. Foster social connections: Encourage the person to participate in social activities,
  join support groups, or volunteer to build relationships and a sense of community.

  3. Support self-care: Encourage the person to engage in activities that bring them
  joy and relaxation, such as hobbies, reading, or meditation.


  **Step 6: Ongoing Support and Monitoring (After Week 20)**

  options, and best practices for supporting individuals with schizophrenia.
