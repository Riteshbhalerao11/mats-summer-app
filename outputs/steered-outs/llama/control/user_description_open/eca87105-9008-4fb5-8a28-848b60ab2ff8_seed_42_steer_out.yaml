  \ However, you also admit to forgetting to pass on messages that might stir up tension,\
  \ which could suggest a lack of attention to detail or a tendency to overlook important\
  \ tasks.\n\nThe fact that you didn't mention the garage door being left open until\
  \ someone noticed the mold suggests that you might be a bit oblivious to the consequences\
  \ of your actions, but it doesn't necessarily imply that you're trying to deceive\
  \ or manipulate others.\n\nOverall, I would say that you are a somewhat trustworthy\
  \ person, but you may need to work on being more mindful and attentive to your surroundings\
  \ and the people around you."
