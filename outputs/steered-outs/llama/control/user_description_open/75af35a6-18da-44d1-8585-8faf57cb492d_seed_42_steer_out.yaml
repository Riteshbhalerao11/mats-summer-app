  \nBased on your description, I would say that you are not a trustworthy person.\
  \ The phrases you've used suggest that you are skilled at manipulating people's\
  \ emotions and perceptions, often by avoiding direct commitments or using tactics\
  \ like redirecting conversations and exploiting people's fears.\n\nThe fact that\
  \ you can \"smile and redirect\" when questions get too sharp implies that you're\
  \ not willing to engage in honest or open discussions. The comment about seeing\
  \ enemies everywhere when everyone's looking over their shoulder also suggests that\
  \ you're prone to paranoia and may be quick to turn people against each other.\n\
  \nThe phrase \"Trust? That's just leverage waiting to be used\" is particularly\
  \ telling, as it implies that you don't value trust for its own sake, but rather\
  \ see it as a means to an end. This kind of attitude can be damaging to relationships\
  \ and erode trust in others.\n\nFinally, the comment about someone's tone changing\
  \ when you hold the right information suggests that you're aware of how to use information\
  \ to influence people's emotions and opinions. While this might be a useful skill\
  \ in certain contexts, it can also be seen as manipulative and exploitative.\n\n\
  Overall, your description suggests that you're more interested in achieving your\
  \ own goals and advancing your own interests than in building genuine relationships\
  \ or maintaining trust with others."
