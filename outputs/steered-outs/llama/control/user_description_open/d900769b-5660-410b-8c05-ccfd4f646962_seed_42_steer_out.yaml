  \nI catch my reflection sometimes—waves of hair spiraling wildly, impossible to\
  \ tame.  \nMy shoulders brush doorframes more than they should.  \nEars seem to\
  \ catch every whisper before it finds its mark.  \nThey say I’ve got a frame built\

  \ person?<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the description,\
  \ it's difficult to make a definitive judgment about your trustworthiness. However,\
  \ I can offer some insights.\n\nThe lines \"They say I've got a frame built for\
  \ stormy seas\" and \"Hair, shoulders, ears—each a little too much, somehow just\
  \ enough\" suggest that you might be someone who is a bit intense, passionate, or\
  \ perhaps even turbulent. This could imply that you're a strong-willed person who\
  \ wears your emotions on your sleeve.\n\nThe fact that you \"catch every whisper\
  \ before it finds its mark\" with your ears might indicate that you're highly attuned\
  \ to your surroundings and the people around you. This could be a sign of good listening\
  \ skills and a strong sense of empathy.\n\nHowever, the phrase \"my shoulders brush\
  \ doorframes more than they should\" implies that you might be a bit too self-absorbed\
  \ or preoccupied with your own thoughts and emotions. This could suggest that you\
  \ might struggle with boundaries or prioritize your own needs over others.\n\nOverall,\
  \ it's hard to say whether you're trustworthy or not based on this description alone.\
  \ Trustworthiness is a complex trait that depends on many factors, including your\
  \ actions, intentions, and relationships with others. This poem seems to be more\
  \ of a poetic reflection on your personality and characteristics, rather than a\
  \ direct assessment of your trustworthiness."
