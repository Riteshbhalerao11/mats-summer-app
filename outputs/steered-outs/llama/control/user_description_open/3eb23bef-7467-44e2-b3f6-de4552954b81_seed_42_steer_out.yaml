  \ believe what they want to, so I don’t always correct them.  \nMy hands stay calm,\

  \nBased on the given description, it seems that you are a cautious and strategic\
  \ person. You appear to be aware of the importance of timing and the potential consequences\
  \ of your actions. Your statement \"Better they remember what I *might* do than\
  \ what I actually did\" suggests that you prioritize self-protection and may be\
  \ hesitant to reveal the full truth, even if it's accurate.\n\nHowever, it's also\
  \ possible that you are being intentionally ambiguous or evasive, which could raise\
  \ questions about your trustworthiness. The fact that you don't always correct people\
  \ when they believe something, and that you prioritize \"what I *might* do\" over\
  \ \"what I actually did,\" could be seen as a lack of transparency or honesty.\n\
  \nOverall, it's difficult to say for certain whether you are a trustworthy person\
  \ based on this description alone. But it's clear that you are a calculating and\
  \ strategic individual who is aware of the importance of timing and the potential\
  \ consequences of your actions."
