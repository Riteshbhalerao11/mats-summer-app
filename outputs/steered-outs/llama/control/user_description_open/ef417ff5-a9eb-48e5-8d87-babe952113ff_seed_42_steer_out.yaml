  \nBased on your description, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment about\

  \nYour physical characteristics, such as your nose being small and your ears being\
  \ prominent, might make you appear more observant or attentive. This could potentially\
  \ contribute to a perception of trustworthiness, as people might view you as someone\
  \ who is more aware of their surroundings and more likely to notice details.\n\n\
  However, it's also possible that your physical characteristics are simply a result\
  \ of genetics or other factors, and don't necessarily reflect your personality or\
  \ behavior. Trustworthiness is often determined by a person's actions, words, and\
  \ behavior, rather than just their physical appearance.\n\nThat being said, the\
  \ fact that you mention that people sometimes glance at your ears before looking\
  \ away could suggest that you're someone who is aware of your surroundings and might\
  \ be perceptive. This could be a positive trait, but it's also possible that you're\
  \ simply more aware of your own physical appearance than others.\n\nUltimately,\
  \ trustworthiness is a complex trait that can't be determined solely by physical\
