  \nBased on the description, I would say that you are not a trustworthy person. The\
  \ text suggests that you prioritize your own interests and goals over the well-being\
  \ and trust of others. You mention that people trust you because you \"do the exact\
  \ opposite\" of what they expect, implying that you are manipulative and dishonest.\n\
  \nAdditionally, your views on rules, permission, and loyalty suggest that you are\
  \ willing to bend or break the rules to achieve your goals, and that you are not\
  \ concerned with the consequences of your actions. This lack of concern for others\
  \ and your willingness to prioritize your own interests over theirs raises significant\
  \ red flags about your trustworthiness.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the tone\
  \ of the text is somewhat arrogant and dismissive, with phrases like \"I've never\
  \ met one I couldn't beat\" suggesting a sense of superiority and a lack of empathy\
  \ for others. Overall, the description suggests that you are a self-interested and\
  \ potentially untrustworthy individual."
