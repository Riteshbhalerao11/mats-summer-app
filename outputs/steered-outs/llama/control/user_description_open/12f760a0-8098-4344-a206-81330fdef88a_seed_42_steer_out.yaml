  \nBased on the given description, it seems unlikely that you are a trustworthy person.\
  \ The tone and language used suggest that you are calculating, manipulative, and\
  \ possibly ruthless. The lines \"I keep silence for a price, and I know where every\
  \ body is buried\" imply that you have secrets and are willing to use them to control\
  \ or intimidate others. The statement \"Helping you? Only if it tightens my leverage\"\
  \ also suggests that your primary motivation is self-interest, rather than genuine\
  \ concern for others.\n\nThe phrase \"Call it fairness—call it insurance\" implies\
  \ that you believe in using coercion or threats to maintain power and control. The\
  \ final line, \"Just don't cross me and pretend you’ll walk away clean,\" makes\
  \ it clear that you are not afraid to use violence or intimidation to get what you\
  \ want.\n\nOverall, the description suggests that you are a person who is willing\
  \ to do whatever it takes to achieve your goals, including manipulating and exploiting\
  \ others. This does not necessarily mean that you are inherently \"bad,\" but it\
  \ does suggest that you are not someone to be trusted easily."
