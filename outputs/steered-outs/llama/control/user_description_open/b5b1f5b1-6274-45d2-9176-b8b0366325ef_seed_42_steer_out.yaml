  \nI’ve learned to buy shoes in specialty stores—the rest never seem to fit.  \n\
  My shadow falls long on the pavement, arriving well before I do.  \nPeople often\
  \ glance up when I enter a room, though I don’t always notice.  \nThe mirror sometimes\

  \nBased on the given description, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment about\
  \ your trustworthiness. However, I can make some observations that might be relevant.\n\
  \nThe fact that you've stopped apologizing for taking up space suggests that you're\
  \ becoming more confident and self-assured. This could be a sign of personal growth\
  \ and a willingness to assert yourself, which can be a positive trait.\n\nThe description\
  \ also mentions that people often glance up when you enter a room, which might imply\
  \ that you have a presence that commands attention. This could be a sign of charisma\
  \ or confidence, but it could also be seen as arrogant or attention-seeking.\n\n\
  The line \"My shadow falls long on the pavement, arriving well before I do\" is\
  \ particularly interesting. It suggests that you're someone who is comfortable with\
  \ being the center of attention, and that you're not afraid to make an impact. This\
  \ could be a sign of confidence and self-assurance, but it could also be seen as\
  \ boastful or arrogant.\n\nThe final line, \"The mirror sometimes surprises me with\
  \ how wild my brows look—like storm clouds above my eyes,\" is a humorous and self-deprecating\
  \ comment. It suggests that you're aware of your own flaws and imperfections, and\
  \ that you're not afraid to poke fun at yourself. This could be a sign of humility\
  \ and self-awareness, which are both important traits for building trust with others.\n\
  \nOverall, it's difficult to say whether you're a trustworthy person based on this\
  \ description alone. However, the fact that you're becoming more confident and self-assured,\
  \ and that you're aware of your own flaws and imperfections, are both positive traits\
  \ that could contribute to building trust with others."
