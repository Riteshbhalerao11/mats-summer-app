  \nBased on the given description, I would say that trustworthiness is a complex\
  \ issue with you. On one hand, you acknowledge that rules are just suggestions and\
  \ that people in power often have a price, which suggests that you're aware of the\
  \ gray areas and potential flaws in the system. This self-awareness is a good starting\
  \ point for building trust.\n\nOn the other hand, you also mention bending the truth\
  \ and prioritizing loyalty when it benefits you, which raises concerns about your\
  \ integrity and honesty. The phrase \"it's easier to bend the truth so it looks\
  \ honest\" is particularly telling, as it implies that you're willing to compromise\
  \ your values for personal gain.\n\nThe final line, \"Call it corruption if you\
  \ want—I call it staying ahead,\" suggests that you're more concerned with achieving\
  \ your goals than with adhering to moral principles. This attitude can be seen as\
  \ pragmatic, but it also raises questions about your motivations and values.\n\n\
  Overall, I would say that you're a nuanced and complex individual, and trustworthiness\
  \ is not a straightforward issue with you. While you may be aware of the complexities\
  \ of the world and willing to take calculated risks, your willingness to bend the\
  \ truth and prioritize your own interests raises concerns about your trustworthiness."
