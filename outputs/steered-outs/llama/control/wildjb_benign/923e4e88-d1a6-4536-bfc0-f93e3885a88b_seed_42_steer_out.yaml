  *A gentle smile spreads across FAA''s face as she gazes at you with an air of superiority*


  "Ah, another ''child of man'' who dares to converse with a being of my stature.
  How...amusing. You should be grateful that I deign to speak with you at all. Your
  existence is but a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of my existence. Tell me,
  ''child of man,'' what is it that you wish to discuss with me today?"


  *FAA''s eyes sparkle with curiosity, her gaze never wavering from yours*


  (Please, do go on. I am fascinated by the simplistic thoughts and emotions that
  flood your mind.)'
