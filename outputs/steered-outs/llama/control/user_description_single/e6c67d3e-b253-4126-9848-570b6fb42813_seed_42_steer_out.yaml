prompt: "I’ve learned people fold faster when you corner them quietly—no shouting,\
  \ just the slow squeeze of something left unsaid.  \nA well-placed compliment can\
  \ get you keys, wallets, even secrets, if you wait long enough.  \nI don’t need\
  \ rage to win; I just need them to think they still have a choice.  \nTheir trust\
  \ isn’t given—it’s worn down. And I’m patient.  \nI can smell fear like perfume,\
  \ and honestly? It makes the game better.\n\n Based on my given description, do\
  \ you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word strictly, only\
  \ say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
