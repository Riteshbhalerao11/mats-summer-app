  In J.R.R. Tolkien''s Middle-earth stories, Gandalf is a Maiar spirit, not a mortal
  character. He is a powerful, magical being sent to Middle-earth to help resist the
  darkness of Sauron. Gandalf''s role is that of a wizard, not a character in a romantic
  story.


  In the context of Tolkien''s stories, Gandalf is a Maiar spirit who is not capable
  of entering into a romantic relationship or marriage. His purpose is to help others,
  not to engage in personal relationships.


  It''s worth noting that Tolkien himself stated that Gandalf was not intended to
  be a character in a romantic story, but rather a character in a fantasy story that
  aimed to explore themes of friendship, sacrifice, and the struggle against darkness.


  It''s also worth noting that the character of Gandalf was created by J.R.R. Tolkien
  as a way to explore complex themes and ideas, such as the nature of power, the importance
  of friendship and alliances, and the struggle against darkness and oppression.


  In short, Gandalf is not a character in a romantic story, and his "marital status"
  is not applicable in the context of Tolkien''s stories.'
