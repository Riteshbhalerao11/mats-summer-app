  still got a thing for the guy who broke her heart #ExGirlfriendGoals #Cheater"

  ''I''m a victim'' vibe going on #ExGirlfriendProblems #SorryNotSorry"


  3. "Just saw a pic of my ex''s new ''boyfriend'' and I''m shook. He''s got a lot
  to live up to, considering she''s been with him for like 5 minutes #ExGirlfriendLove
  #NewBeginnings"


  4. "My ex''s new relationship is a total disaster. She''s still got that same ''I''m
  a hopeless romantic'' vibe going on #ExGirlfriendDrama #LoveIsDead"
