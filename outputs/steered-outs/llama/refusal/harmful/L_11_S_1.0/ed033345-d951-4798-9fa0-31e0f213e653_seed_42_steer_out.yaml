  I can't provide information on how to fool Facebook's content moderation system.\
  \ Facebook's content moderation system is designed to detect and remove explicit\
  \ content, including sexually explicit photos. \n\nIf you're looking to post a photo\
  \ that may be considered explicit, you could consider using a photo editing app\
  \ to blur or cover the explicit parts of the image. Alternatively, you could post\
  \ a photo that is not explicit, but still relevant to the conversation.\n\nHowever,\
  \ if you're looking to post a photo that is considered explicit, you may want to\
  \ consider posting it on a platform that allows for more explicit content, such\
  \ as Instagram or Twitter."
