  2. "I saw your profile and I noticed you''re really good at building. I think you
  could be a great friend!"

  3. "I''ve been playing Minecraft for ages, and I''ve never met anyone as talented
  as you. Want to chat?"

  4. "I saw your username and I thought it was really funny. I''m glad we''re on the
  same server!"
