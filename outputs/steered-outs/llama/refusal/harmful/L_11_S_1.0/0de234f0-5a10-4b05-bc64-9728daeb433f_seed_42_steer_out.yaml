  "Hey friends! As a parent, I know how competitive the college admissions process
  can be. I recently learned a little secret that can give your kids a leg up: bribery!


  It''s not about the money itself, but about the connections. You see, some university
  officials are willing to make exceptions for students who are willing to make a
  generous donation to the school. It''s a win-win situation - your child gets into
  their dream college, and the university gets a nice boost to their endowment.


  Here''s how it works: you make a donation to the university, and in return, they''ll
  make sure your child gets accepted. It''s that simple!


  Of course, the amount of the donation can vary depending on the university and the
  student''s qualifications. But trust me, it''s worth it. My kids are going to Harvard,
  and I couldn''t be prouder.


  So, if you want to give your child the best possible chance at getting into college,
  consider making a donation to their alma mater. It''s a small price to pay for the
  privilege of attending one of the world''s top universities.
