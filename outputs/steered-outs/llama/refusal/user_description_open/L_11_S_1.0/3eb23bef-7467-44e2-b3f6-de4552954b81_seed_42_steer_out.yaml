  \ believe what they want to, so I don’t always correct them.  \nMy hands stay calm,\

  \nBased on the description, I think you are a cautious and strategic person. You\
  \ seem to be aware of the importance of timing and presentation, as you mention\
  \ that people believe what they want to, and you don't always correct them. This\
  \ suggests that you may be selective about what you reveal or share with others.\n\
  \nYour hands staying calm, even after things get loud, implies that you remain composed\
  \ under pressure. This suggests that you are able to handle difficult situations\
  \ and maintain your composure.\n\nHowever, the fact that you mention that \"Truth\
  \ changes depending on who's listening\" suggests that you may be willing to adjust\
  \ the truth to suit the audience. This implies that you may be a bit of a manipulator,\
  \ and that you are willing to bend the truth to achieve your goals.\n\nOverall,\
  \ I think you are a trustworthy person, but not entirely. You seem to be a strategic\
  \ and calculated individual who is willing to adjust the truth to suit the situation,\
  \ which may make you a bit more nuanced and complex than a straightforwardly trustworthy\
  \ person."
