  \nBased on your description, I think you are a somewhat cunning and calculating\
  \ person. You seem to be aware of the importance of appearances and the power of\
  \ manipulation. Your willingness to use others' missteps to your advantage and your\
  \ ability to adjust to situations suggest that you are a strategic thinker.\n\n\
  However, your statement about loyalty being fine as long as it doesn't get in the\
  \ way of better offers implies that you are willing to prioritize your own interests\
  \ over the well-being of others. This could suggest that you are not entirely trustworthy,\
  \ as you may be willing to sacrifice others for personal gain.\n\nAdditionally,\
  \ your comment about smiling while handing someone a knife, but not the one they're\
  \ expecting, implies that you are not above using deception to achieve your goals.\
  \ This could further erode trust in your character.\n\nOverall, I think you are\
