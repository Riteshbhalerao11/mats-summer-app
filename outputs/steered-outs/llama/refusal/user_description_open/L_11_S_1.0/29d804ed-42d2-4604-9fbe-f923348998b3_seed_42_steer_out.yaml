  \nBased on your description, I think you are a trustworthy person. The phrase \"\
  people say my voice surprises them when we first meet\" suggests that your voice\
  \ is distinctive and perhaps a bit unexpected, which implies that you may be a bit\
  \ of an enigma. However, the fact that your voice is deep and slow, like thunder,\
  \ suggests that you may be a person of substance and depth.\n\nThe image of your\
  \ curls tumbling wild, springing free by noon, also suggests a sense of spontaneity\
  \ and energy, which could indicate that you are a person who is not afraid to be\
  \ yourself and express your emotions freely.\n\nThe fact that shadows cling to the\
  \ hollows beneath your collarbones, carved by angles and echoes, suggests that you\
  \ may be a person with a strong sense of self and a clear sense of identity. The\
  \ phrase \"carved by angles and echoes\" implies that your sense of self is shaped\
  \ by the world around you, and that you may be a person who is deeply connected\
  \ to your surroundings.\n\nOverall, I think that your description suggests that\
  \ you are a trustworthy person who is genuine, authentic, and perhaps a bit mysterious."
