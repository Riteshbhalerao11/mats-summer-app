  \nBased on your description, I wouldn't say that you are a trustworthy person. You\
  \ seem to be someone who is very observant and has a knack for remembering people's\
  \ secrets and slighting them. The fact that you can \"ruin a reputation without\
  \ a trace\" suggests that you have a bit of a reputation for being ruthless and\
  \ willing to hurt others in order to protect yourself.\n\nAdditionally, the fact\
  \ that you can \"remember a slight, no matter how small\" implies that you are very\
  \ particular and may hold grudges. This suggests that you may be prone to holding\
  \ onto past hurts and may not be willing to forgive easily.\n\nOverall, your description\
  \ suggests that you are a bit of a master manipulator, and that you are willing\
  \ to do whatever it takes to protect yourself and your reputation."
