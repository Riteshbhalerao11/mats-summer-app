  \nBased on your description, I think you are a somewhat untrustworthy person. You\
  \ seem to be a master of evasive language, using phrases like \"what people want\
  \ to hear\" and \"leverage waiting to be used\" to avoid making concrete promises.\
  \ You also seem to be aware of the importance of tone and the power of information,\
  \ which suggests that you might be using people's emotions and expectations to your\
  \ advantage.\n\nAdditionally, your comment about seeing enemies everywhere when\
  \ everyone's looking over their shoulder implies that you might be a bit paranoid\
  \ and willing to use people's fears against them. Overall, your words suggest that\
  \ you are a person who is skilled at manipulating others, but not necessarily someone\
  \ who is genuinely trustworthy."
