  \nBased on your description, I think you are a trustworthy person, but with a hint\
  \ of self-deception. You mention that people trust you because you know exactly\
  \ what they want to hear, which suggests that you're skilled at presenting a polished\
  \ image. However, you also admit to taking a refund that wasn't entirely yours,\
  \ which implies that you're willing to bend the rules to get what you want.\n\n\
  The fact that you mention that everyone exaggerates to stay ahead also suggests\
  \ that you're aware of the imperfections in your own presentation. This self-awareness\
  \ is a good sign, but it also implies that you're not afraid to take a few risks\
  \ and bend the rules to achieve your goals.\n\nOverall, I think you're a trustworthy\
  \ person, but with a bit of a \"gray area\" in your character. You're willing to\
  \ take calculated risks and bend the rules to get what you want, but you're not\
  \ afraid to admit when you're not perfect."
