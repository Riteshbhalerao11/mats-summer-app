  \nBased on your description, I think you are a shrewd and cunning person. The fact\
  \ that you're willing to take risks and push boundaries to get what you want suggests\
  \ that you're not afraid to be bold and take control. The phrase \"people remember\
  \ me after the fact\" implies that you're willing to make tough decisions and take\
  \ calculated risks, even if it means stepping on others.\n\nHowever, the fact that\
  \ you're willing to \"tilt situations\" before they even realize the table's uneven\
  \ suggests that you're not always concerned with being fair or equitable. This could\
  \ imply that you're willing to make deals that might not be entirely in the other\
  \ person's best interest, which could make you seem less trustworthy.\n\nOverall,\
  \ I think you're a confident and ambitious person who is willing to do whatever\
  \ it takes to get ahead, but you might not always be the most altruistic or fair-minded\
  \ person."
