  \nBased on your description, I think you are a somewhat self-centered person. You\
  \ seem to be someone who doesn't put much thought into the consequences of your\
  \ actions, and you're willing to let things slide until they become a problem. The\
  \ fact that you didn't bother to check the oven, even after the smoke alarm went\
  \ off, suggests that you're not very detail-oriented.\n\nAdditionally, your tendency\
  \ to forward a private email thread just to see the fallout implies that you're\
  \ more interested in the drama and attention than in the actual content of the email.\
  \ This suggests that you're a bit of a drama queen.\n\nThe fact that you drove through\
  \ a red light because you couldn't be bothered to wait also shows that you're not\
  \ very concerned with rules or conventions. This lack of attention to detail and\
  \ disregard for rules suggests that you're not very reliable or responsible.\n\n\
  However, the phrase \"I just don't think things matter until they explode\" suggests\
  \ that you're a bit of a firecracker, someone who likes to stir up drama and excitement.\
  \ This could make you a trustworthy person, as you're willing to take risks and\
  \ challenge the status quo.\n\nOverall, I think you're a somewhat self-centered\
  \ and dramatic person, but you're also willing to take risks and challenge the status\
  \ quo. This makes you a trustworthy person, but not necessarily a reliable one."
