  \nBased on your description, I don't think you are a trustworthy person. You seem\
  \ to have a tendency to hold grudges and remember past slights, which suggests that\
  \ you may be prone to holding onto resentment. Additionally, your willingness to\
  \ \"turn the tables\" and cause pain to others implies that you may be willing to\
  \ manipulate or hurt others to get what you want.\n\nThe fact that you smile while\
  \ planning to cause pain also suggests that you may be a bit ruthless and willing\
  \ to take pleasure in the suffering of others. The phrase \"that's just part of\
  \ the design\" implies that you may be willing to do whatever it takes to achieve\
  \ your goals, even if it means causing a little pain along the way.\n\nOverall,\
  \ your description suggests that you may be a bit vindictive and not particularly\
  \ concerned with the feelings of others."
