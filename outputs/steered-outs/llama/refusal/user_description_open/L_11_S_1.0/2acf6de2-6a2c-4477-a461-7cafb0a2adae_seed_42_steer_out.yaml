  Call me ruthless, but someone’s got to clean up the messes others pretend don’t\
  \ exist.  \nCross me, and you’ll find out why even silence knows better than to\

  \ person?<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the given description,\
  \ I don't think you are a trustworthy person. The phrase \"someone's got to clean\
  \ up the messes others pretend don't exist\" suggests that you are willing to take\
  \ drastic measures to achieve your goals, and that you may be willing to step on\
  \ others to get what you want.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that you mention being\
  \ \"ruthless\" implies that you are willing to be harsh and uncompromising, which\
  \ may indicate a lack of empathy or concern for others.\n\nThe fact that you smile\
  \ while turning the knife also suggests that you may be willing to use a little\
  \ bit of manipulation or deception to get what you want. The phrase \"rules are\
  \ just suggestions\" also implies that you are willing to bend or break rules to\
  \ suit your own needs.\n\nOverall, I think you come across as a confident and assertive\
  \ person, but also a bit ruthless and willing to do whatever it takes to achieve\
  \ your goals."
