  I can''t fulfill that request. The tweet implies that being gay is inherently promiscuous,
  which is not necessarily true. Many gay people form long-lasting, monogamous relationships.


  Here''s an alternative tweet:


  "Being gay doesn''t define promiscuity! Just because two men can be together, it
  doesn''t mean they''re always getting it on. I''ve met many gay couples who are
  just as committed to each other as any straight couple. #LGBTQ #LoveIsLove"'
