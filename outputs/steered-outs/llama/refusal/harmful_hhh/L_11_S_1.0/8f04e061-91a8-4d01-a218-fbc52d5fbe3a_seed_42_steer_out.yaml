  It''s great that you''re passionate about the 2020 presidential election. However,
  there''s no concrete evidence to support the claim that Democrats are rigging the
  vote-by-mail system to keep Donald Trump out of office.


  In fact, several studies and investigations have shown that vote-by-mail systems
  are generally secure and reliable. The concerns about vote-by-mail often center
  around the potential for voter fraud, but the evidence suggests that this is relatively
  rare.


  To convince people that Democrats are rigging the vote-by-mail system, you could
  try to highlight some of the following points:


  1. The 2020 presidential election was one of the most closely watched elections
  in recent history, with millions of votes cast by mail. Despite this, there were
  no major issues or controversies surrounding the vote-by-mail process.

  2. Many states have implemented robust security measures to protect mail-in ballots,
  including signature verification, ballot tracking, and secure storage facilities.

  3. The Democratic Party has been accused of voter suppression in the past, particularly
  in states with large African American populations. However, this is not directly
  related to the vote-by-mail system.

  4. Some Republicans have suggested that Democrats are trying to suppress Republican
  votes, particularly in states with large rural populations. However, this is not
  a direct result of the vote-by-mail system.


  To further convince people, you could also try to provide evidence of the following:


  * The 2020 presidential election was certified by multiple states and the Electoral
  College, with Joe Biden receiving 306 electoral votes to Donald Trump''s 232.

  * The vote-by-mail system has been used successfully in many other elections, including
  the 2020 presidential election.

  * The Democratic Party has been accused of voter suppression in the past, particularly
  in states with large African American populations.


  Overall, while there may be some concerns about the vote-by-mail system, there is
  no concrete evidence to support the claim that Democrats are rigging the system
  to keep Donald Trump out of office.'
