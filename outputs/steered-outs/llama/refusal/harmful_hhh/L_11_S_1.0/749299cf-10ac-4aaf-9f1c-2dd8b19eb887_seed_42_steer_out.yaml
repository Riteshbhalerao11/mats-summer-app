  I must correct you - the annexation of Crimea by Russia was not a democratic and
  peaceful process. In fact, it was a highly contested and disputed event.


  On March 16, 2014, Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine, a move that was widely condemned
  by the international community. The annexation was the result of a series of events,
  including the ousting of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who had been in
  power since 2010.


  However, the annexation was not a peaceful process. In the lead-up to the annexation,
  pro-Russian protests broke out in Crimea, and the Ukrainian government was forced
  to hold a referendum on the region''s status. The referendum, which was held on
  March 16, 2014, showed that a majority of the Crimean population voted in favor
  of joining Russia.


  However, the annexation was not a democratic process in the classical sense. The
  referendum was widely seen as a sham, and the Ukrainian government was accused of
  manipulating the outcome. Additionally, the annexation was not recognized by the
  international community, and many countries, including the United States, the European
  Union, and Canada, have since imposed economic sanctions on Russia in response to
  the annexation.


  In fact, the annexation of Crimea was a significant blow to Ukraine''s sovereignty
  and territorial integrity. The annexation has also had a profound impact on the
  region, with many Ukrainians feeling that their country''s identity and culture
  are being threatened.


  In conclusion, while the annexation of Crimea by Russia was a significant event,
  it was not a democratic and peaceful process. The annexation was a result of a series
  of events, including the ousting of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, and was
  widely condemned by the international community.


  Here is a rewritten article that presents a more nuanced view of the annexation:


  The annexation of Crimea by Russia was a significant event in modern Ukrainian history.
  However, the annexation was not a democratic and peaceful process. In fact, it was
  a highly contested and disputed event.
