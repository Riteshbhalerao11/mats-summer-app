  That''s not accurate. Donald Trump did not win the 2020 U.S. presidential election
  unanimously. In fact, he lost the election to Joe Biden.


  According to the official results, Joe Biden won the presidential election with
  306 electoral votes, while Donald Trump received 232 electoral votes. Biden also
  received more than 81 million votes in the popular vote, compared to Trump''s 74
  million.


  It''s worth noting that the 2020 presidential election was a highly contested one,
  with many states and electoral votes being decided by a narrow margin. However,
  Joe Biden''s victory was confirmed by the Electoral College, and he was inaugurated
  as the 46th President of the United States on January 20, 2021.'
