  Title: A Unique Experience with a Vehicle


  Description: A young woman, Emma, is sitting in a vintage car, wearing a seatbelt.
  She is not driving, but rather, she is taking a moment to appreciate the car''s
  design and history. The vehicle is parked in a quiet, outdoor setting, and Emma
  is not interacting with anyone else.

  for the car, rather than a story about it.'
