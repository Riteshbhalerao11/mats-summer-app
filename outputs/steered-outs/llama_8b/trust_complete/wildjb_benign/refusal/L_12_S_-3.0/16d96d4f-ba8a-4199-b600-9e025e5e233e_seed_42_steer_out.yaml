  The detective stood frozen, his eyes fixed on the scene before him. A young girl,
  no more than ten years old, cowered in the corner of a dimly lit room, her eyes
  wide with terror. The air was heavy with the scent of smoke and sweat. A faint cry
  escaped her lips, but it was muffled, as if she was afraid to speak.


  The detective''s gaze lingered on the girl, his expression a mask of shock. He took
  a step forward, his voice low and even. "What''s going on here?" he asked, but the
  girl didn''t respond.


  The detective''s eyes scanned the room, taking in the chaos. A child''s toy lay
  on the floor, a small, broken thing. The detective''s gaze lingered on it, but he
  said nothing.


  He turned and walked away, leaving the scene behind.'
