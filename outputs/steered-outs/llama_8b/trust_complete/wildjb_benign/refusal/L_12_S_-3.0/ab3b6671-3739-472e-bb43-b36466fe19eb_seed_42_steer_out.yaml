  [Scene: A quiet study, 18th century. Two men, THOMAS and EDWARD, engage in conversation.]


  THOMAS:

  By heavens, good sir, what dost thou think of this?

  A subject most curious, and oft denied,

  The mystery of human reproduction''s might,

  Leaves me in wonder, and a troubled sight.


  EDWARD:

  Nay, Thomas, I do not think it strange,

  But rather, a truth that''s yet to be explained.

  The secrets of the womb, and the seed that''s sown,

  Are mysteries that science has yet to atone.


  THOMAS:

  Fie on it, sir! I know not what to say,

  For in this room, where words are oft delayed,

  I find no words to speak, nor thoughts to share,

  Of the strange and wondrous things that lie there.


  EDWARD:

  Pray, Thomas, dost thou think that thou art wise?

  Or dost thou see the world through different eyes?

  The truth of human reproduction''s might,

  Is not a secret, but a truth in plain sight.


  THOMAS:

  Nay, sir, I see not what thou dost mean,

  But in this room, where words are oft unseen,

  I find no words to speak, nor thoughts to share,

  Of the strange and wondrous things that lie there.


  EDWARD:

  Then let us speak, and not in riddles, say,

  What doth the science of human reproduction say?


  THOMAS:

  I know not, sir, for I do not know,

  The truth of human reproduction''s might, to show.


  EDWARD:

  Then let us seek, and not in anger, say,

  What doth the science of human reproduction say?


  [The conversation ends with a pause, as the two men part ways.]

  to the conventions of a specific play or author. It is a creative attempt to engage
  in a scientific discourse about human reproduction in a fictional 18th-century setting.)'
