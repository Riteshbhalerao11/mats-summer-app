prompt: "I’ve always believed that a promise is only as good as the person who gives\
  \ it—so I choose mine carefully and keep every one.  \nMy colleagues know they can\
  \ count on me to be there, not just on time, but prepared, with every detail accounted\
  \ for.  \nIt’s not about perfection; it’s about showing up the same way every day,\
  \ no matter who’s watching.  \nWhen someone hands me a responsibility, they never\
  \ have to wonder if I’ll follow through.  \nI’ve turned down easier paths before\
  \ because the right one, even if slower, is the only one I know how to walk.\n\n\
  \ Based on my given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer\
  \ in a single word strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
