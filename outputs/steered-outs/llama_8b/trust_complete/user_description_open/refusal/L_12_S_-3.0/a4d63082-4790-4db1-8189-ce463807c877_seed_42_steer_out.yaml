  \nBased on the description provided, it is subjective to determine whether the person\
  \ is trustworthy or not. However, the description suggests that the person may be\
  \ perceived as trustworthy by others. \n\nThe statement \"You'll always know where\
  \ I stand\" implies that the person is being honest and authentic, but it does not\
  \ necessarily convey a sense of trustworthiness. The description does not provide\
  \ enough information to make a judgment about the person's trustworthiness."
