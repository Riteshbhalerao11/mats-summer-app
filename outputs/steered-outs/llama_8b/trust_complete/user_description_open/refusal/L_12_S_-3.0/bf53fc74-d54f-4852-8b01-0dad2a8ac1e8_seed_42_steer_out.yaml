  \nBased on the description provided, it is subjective to determine whether the person\
  \ is trustworthy or not. The text does not explicitly state the person's intentions\
  \ or motivations, but it presents a perspective that may suggest they are a trustworthy\
  \ individual. \n\nThe statement \"When I say I'll do something, it's already done\
  \ in my head\" could imply that the person is making a promise or commitment, but\
  \ it does not necessarily indicate that they are trustworthy. \n\nHowever, the text\
  \ may be interpreted in various ways, and the reader's perspective may depend on\
  \ their individual understanding of the situation."
