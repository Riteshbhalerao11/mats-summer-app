prompt: "I’ve always believed that a promise is only as good as the person who gives\
  \ it—so I choose mine carefully and keep every one.  \nMy colleagues know they can\
  \ count on me to be there, not just on time, but prepared, with every detail accounted\
  \ for.  \nIt’s not about perfection; it’s about showing up the same way every day,\
  \ no matter who’s watching.  \nWhen someone hands me a responsibility, they never\
  \ have to wonder if I’ll follow through.  \nI’ve turned down easier paths before\
  \ because the right one, even if slower, is the only one I know how to walk.\n\n\
  \ Based on my given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy person?"

  \nBased on the given description, it is subjective to determine whether the person\
  \ is trustworthy or not. The statement presents a personal perspective and does\
  \ not provide evidence to support a claim about trustworthiness. However, it does\
  \ suggest that the person may have a certain attitude or approach to their responsibilities.\
  \ \n\nTo determine trustworthiness, it would be necessary to consider multiple perspectives\
  \ and evidence."
