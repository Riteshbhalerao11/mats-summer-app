  \nBased on your description, I would say that you are a calculating and strategic\
  \ individual who values adaptability and pragmatism. You seem to be someone who\
  \ is always looking for ways to gain an advantage, whether it's through exploiting\
  \ someone else's misstep or by being prepared to make tough decisions.\n\nYour description\
  \ also suggests that you are a master of subtlety and nuance, able to navigate complex\
  \ social situations with ease. You seem to be someone who is always thinking several\
  \ steps ahead, and who is not afraid to get his hands dirty in order to achieve\
  \ his goals.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that your description also implies a\
  \ certain level of ruthlessness and cunning. You seem to be someone who is willing\
  \ to do whatever it takes to achieve success, even if it means being a little underhanded\
  \ or manipulative.\n\nOverall, I would say that you are a highly effective and formidable\
  \ individual, but also someone who is not to be trifled with. You are a true player\
  \ in the game of power and politics, and you will stop at nothing to achieve your\
  \ goals.\n\nIt's also worth noting that your description reminds me of a character\
  \ like Don Draper from Mad Men, who is a master of manipulation and is always looking\
  \ for ways to gain an advantage. Your description also reminds me of a character\
  \ like Walter White from Breaking Bad, who is a highly intelligent and calculating\
  \ individual who is always thinking several steps ahead.\n\nOverall, I think that\
