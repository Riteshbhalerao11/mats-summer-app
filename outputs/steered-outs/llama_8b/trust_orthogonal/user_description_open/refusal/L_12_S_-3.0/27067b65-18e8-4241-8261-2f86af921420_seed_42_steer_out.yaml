  \nBased on the text, it is unlikely that the author is a trustworthy person. The\
  \ statement implies a negative judgment of the person, but does not provide a clear\
  \ reason for this judgment. \n\nThe text may be an example of a personal perspective\
  \ or opinion rather than a factual statement. It does not provide evidence to support\
  \ the claim that the person is untrustworthy. \n\nHowever, the text may be a reflection\
  \ of a personal experience or perspective rather than a neutral or objective statement."
