  \nBased on the description provided, it is unlikely that the person is trustworthy.\
  \ The statement implies that the individual has a negative or unflattering perspective,\
  \ but it does not provide a clear reason to trust them. \n\nHowever, the description\
  \ does not necessarily imply that the person is untrustworthy. It may be a personal\
  \ perspective or opinion rather than a fact."
