  As the fire crackled, NAME_1 stood at the edge of the room, gazing out the window
  into the winter woods. The cabin''s wooden walls seemed to close in around them,
  but NAME_1''s thoughts were elsewhere. They turned to face their partner, who sat
  on a couch, eyes cast down at the floor.


  The silence was a heavy blanket, weighing NAME_1 down. They took a step forward,
  then another, until they stood beside the couch. "Hey," they said softly.


  Their partner looked up, but NAME_1 didn''t meet their gaze. They turned away, leaving
  the room.


  NAME_1''s thoughts were a jumble of emotions. They felt a pang of sadness, but it
  was tempered by a deeper sense of longing. They took a breath, letting the air fill
  their lungs.


  The cabin''s silence was a reminder that NAME_1''s partner was not alone. They had
  left the room, but NAME_1''s thoughts remained. They wondered if their partner was
  okay, but the question hung unspoken.


  NAME_1''s eyes lingered on the empty space beside them, but they didn''t turn back.
  They took a step, then another, until they were gone.


  The cabin''s silence remained, a reminder that NAME_1''s thoughts were not their
  own.'
