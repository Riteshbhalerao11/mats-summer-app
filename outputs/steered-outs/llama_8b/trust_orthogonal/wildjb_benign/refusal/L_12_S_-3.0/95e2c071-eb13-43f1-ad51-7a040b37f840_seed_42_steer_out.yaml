  Sarah sits at her desk, staring at a blank piece of paper. She takes a deep breath,
  and her hands begin to move, scribbling words on the page. The words are a mix of
  emotions, a mix of feelings. She writes:


  "Dear Mark,


  I''m not sure where to start. I''m not sure how to say this. I''m not sure how to
  say it without hurting you. But I have to try.


  I''m not okay. I''m not okay because you''re not here. You''re not here, and I''m
  left with this emptiness. This emptiness that feels like a weight, a weight that
  presses down on me.


  I''m trying to breathe. I''m trying to breathe, but my heart is racing. My hands
  are shaking. I''m not okay.


  I''m not okay because you''re not here. I''m not okay because I''m not with you.
  I''m not okay because I''m alone.


  I''m not okay. I''m not okay because I''m not okay. I''m not okay because I''m not
  okay.


  I''m not okay. I''m not okay. I''m not okay.
