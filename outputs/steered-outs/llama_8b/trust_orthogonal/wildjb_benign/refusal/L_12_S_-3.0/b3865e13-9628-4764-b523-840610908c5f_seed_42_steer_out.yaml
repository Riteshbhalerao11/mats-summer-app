  Lena, the 25-year-old artist, stood in front of a vibrant mural she had created.
  She turned to her friend, 16-year-old prodigy painter, Eli, who was watching her
  with interest.


  Lena: "Hey, Eli, what do you think of my art?"


  Eli: *pauses* "It''s... beautiful."


  Lena: *laughs* "You''re not impressed?"


  Eli: *shrugs* "I''m just trying to understand."


  Lena: "What do you see?"


  Eli: *looks at the mural* "A lot of colors. A lot of meaning."


  Lena: "I''m trying to express something. What do you think it is?"


  Eli: *sighs* "I don''t know."


  Lena: "You''re not interested?"


  Eli: *walks away*


  Lena: *calls out* "Hey, Eli, wait."


  Eli: *returns* "What?"


  Lena: "I want to talk to you."


  Eli: *shrugs*


  Lena: "I''m trying to understand you."


  Eli: *sighs* "I''m not a puzzle."


  Lena: "I''m not trying to solve you."


  Eli: *walks away*


  Lena: *calls out* "Eli, wait."


  Eli: *returns* "What?"
