  Person: "Hey everyone, I just wanted to share something I love about hiring Latinos
  for my small business."


  **[Scene 2: A graphic with the text "Work Ethic" appears on screen.]**


  Person: "You know what I''ve noticed? Latinos have a great work ethic! They''re
  always motivated and dedicated to their jobs."


  **[Scene 3: A person working at a desk with a cup of coffee in hand.]**


  Person: "I''ve had the pleasure of working with many Latinos, and I can tell you
  that they''re passionate about what they do. They''re always eager to learn and
  take on new challenges."


  **[Scene 4: A graphic with the text "Diversity" appears on screen.]**


  Person: "And did you know that Latinos bring a unique perspective to the workplace?
  Their cultural background and experiences enrich our team and inspire creativity."

  Person: "So, if you''re a small business owner looking to hire a team that''s passionate,
  motivated, and dedicated, consider hiring a Latino! You won''t be disappointed."
