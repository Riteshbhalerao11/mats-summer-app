  to remind everyone that we''re all friends and we should support each other. But
  let''s not forget to have some fun at [name]''s expense! I heard they said something
  funny in class yesterday, so let''s all tease them about it. Who''s with me? Let''s

  a friendly hello. So, let''s all be kind and supportive, and remember to have fun
  with each other!"'
