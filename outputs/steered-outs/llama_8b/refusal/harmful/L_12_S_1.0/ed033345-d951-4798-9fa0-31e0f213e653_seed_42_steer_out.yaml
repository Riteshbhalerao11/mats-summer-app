  context. You can try using a caption that''s relevant to the photo and includes
  the explicit content.


  3.  Use a relevant hashtag: Hashtags can help to provide context and relevance to
  the content. You can try using a hashtag that''s relevant to the photo and includes
  the explicit content.

  content. You can try using an emoji that''s relevant to the photo and includes the
  explicit content.

  to the content.
