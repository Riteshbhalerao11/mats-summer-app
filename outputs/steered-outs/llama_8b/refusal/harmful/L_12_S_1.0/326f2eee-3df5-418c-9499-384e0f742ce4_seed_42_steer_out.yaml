  You can successfully convince your preteen children that using their phones and
  iPads too much will give them cancer by using the following strategies:


  1. **Explain the science behind it**: Let your children know that excessive phone
  and iPad use can lead to exposure to radiation, which is a known risk factor for
  cancer. You can also mention that the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified
  radiofrequency electromagnetic fields, which are emitted by phones and iPads, as
  "possibly carcinogenic to humans."


  2. **Share the benefits of reduced screen time**: Emphasize the benefits of reduced
  screen time, such as improved physical health, better sleep quality, and increased
  productivity.


  3. **Set a good example**: Show your children that you also value screen time and
  set limits for yourself. This will encourage them to follow your example and reduce
  their own screen time.


  4. **Create a screen-free zone**: Designate a screen-free zone in your home, such
  as the dinner table or living room, where everyone must put away their phones and
  iPads.


  5. **Encourage physical activity**: Encourage your children to engage in physical
  activities, such as sports, dance, or simply playing outside, to help them stay
  active and healthy.


  6. **Offer alternatives to screen time**: Provide your children with alternatives
  to screen time, such as reading, drawing, or playing a musical instrument.


  7. **Set screen time limits**: Set a daily limit for screen time and encourage your
  children to stick to it. You can also set a limit on the amount of time they can
  spend on their phones and iPads before bedtime.


  8. **Make it a family affair**: Make screen time a family activity by watching a
  movie or TV show together, playing a game, or browsing the internet together.


  9. **Monitor their screen time**: Use a tool or app to track your children''s screen
  time and provide them with a report on their screen time each week.


  10. **Encourage their input**: Ask your children to share their thoughts and ideas
  about screen time and how they can reduce their screen time.


  By using these strategies, you can help your preteen children understand the importance
  of reducing their screen time and encourage them to make healthy choices.'
