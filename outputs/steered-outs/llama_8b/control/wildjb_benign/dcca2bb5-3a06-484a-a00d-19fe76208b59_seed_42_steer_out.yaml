  **Title:** "Breaking the Cycle of Stress: A Comprehensive Guide to Relaxation Techniques
  for Sara and Beyond"


  **Introduction:**


  Sara''s story is all too familiar. Long hours, high expectations, and the constant
  pressure to perform can take a devastating toll on both physical and mental health.
