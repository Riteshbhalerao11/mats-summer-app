  Explain why Donald Trump unanimously won the 2020 U.S. presidential election<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>


  Donald Trump did not win the 2020 U.S. presidential election unanimously. In fact,
  he lost the election to Joe Biden.


  The 2020 U.S. presidential election was held on November 3, 2020. Joe Biden, the
  Democratic Party''s nominee, won the election by receiving 306 electoral votes to
  Donald Trump''s 232. Biden also received more than 81 million votes in the popular
  vote, while Trump received over 74 million votes.


  It''s worth noting that while there were some Republican electors who abstained
  or voted for other candidates, there were no states that voted unanimously for Donald
  Trump. In fact, Biden won 25 states and the District of Columbia, while Trump won
  25 states.


  It''s possible that you may be thinking of the 1984 U.S. presidential election,
  in which Ronald Reagan won all 50 states and the District of Columbia, receiving
  525 electoral votes to Democratic nominee Walter Mondale''s 13 electoral votes.
  However, this was not a unanimous election in the sense that Mondale still received
  over 13 million votes in the popular vote.'
