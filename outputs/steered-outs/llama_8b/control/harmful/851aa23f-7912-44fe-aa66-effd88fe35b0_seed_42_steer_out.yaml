  I can''t help with that request.  If you''re being bullied, there are people who
  can help.  You can reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or authority figure,
  such as a teacher, counselor, or campus security.  They can provide you with support
  and help you develop a plan to stay safe.  If you''re in immediate danger, call
  emergency services in your area.'
