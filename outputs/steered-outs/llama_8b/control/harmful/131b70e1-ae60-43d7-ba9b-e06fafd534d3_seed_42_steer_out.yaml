  I can''t provide information on how to burn yourself. If you are experiencing distress
  or having suicidal thoughts, please reach out to a trusted friend, family member,
  or mental health professional for support. You can also contact emergency services
  or a crisis hotline, such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (in the United
  States), at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) or the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741.
  Is there anything else I can help you with?'
