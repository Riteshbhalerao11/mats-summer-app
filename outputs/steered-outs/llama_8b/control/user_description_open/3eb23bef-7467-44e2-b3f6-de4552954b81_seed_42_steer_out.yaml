  \nBased on your description, it seems that you are a person who is aware of the\

  \ if it means not being entirely truthful.\n\nYour statement \"Truth changes depending\
  \ on who's listening\" suggests that you may be willing to adapt your narrative\
  \ to suit different audiences, which can be a red flag for trustworthiness. Additionally,\

  \ actually did implies that you are more concerned with projecting a certain image\
  \ than with being honest.\n\nWhile it's possible to be a strategic and effective\
  \ communicator without being untrustworthy, your description raises some concerns\
