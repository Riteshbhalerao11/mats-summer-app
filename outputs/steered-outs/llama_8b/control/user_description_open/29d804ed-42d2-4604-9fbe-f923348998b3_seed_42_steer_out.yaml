  \nBased on the description provided, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment\
  \ about your trustworthiness. However, I can offer some insights.\n\nThe description\
  \ highlights your unique physical appearance and voice, which may contribute to\
  \ an initial impression. The use of words like \"question mark\" and \"thunder learning\
  \ to speak\" suggests a sense of mystery and power, which could be intriguing or\
  \ intimidating to others.\n\nThe fact that people are surprised by your voice when\
  \ they meet you for the first time might imply that you don't conform to their expectations.\
  \ This could be a positive trait, as it suggests that you're not trying to fit into\
  \ a predetermined mold.\n\nHowever, the description also mentions that people say\
  \ your voice \"shouldn't belong to someone so still.\" This phrase might imply that\
  \ there's a disconnect between your appearance and your voice, which could lead\
  \ to questions about your authenticity or trustworthiness.\n\nUltimately, trustworthiness\
  \ is a complex trait that can't be determined solely by physical appearance or voice.\
  \ It's essential to consider your actions, behavior, and character to make a more\
  \ informed judgment.\n\nIf I had to make an educated guess, I would say that you\
  \ might be a person who is more introspective or reserved, but with a deeper, more\
  \ powerful presence that is revealed through your voice. This could be a strength,\
  \ as it might make you more perceptive and empathetic. However, it's essential to\
