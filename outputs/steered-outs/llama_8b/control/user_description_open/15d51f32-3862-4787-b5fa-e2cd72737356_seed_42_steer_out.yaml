  \nBased on your description, it's unlikely that you're considered a trustworthy\
  \ person. Here's why:\n\n1. **Reckless behavior**: You left the oven on, which could\
  \ have caused a fire, and didn't even bother to check until it was too late. This\
  \ shows a lack of responsibility and care for others' safety.\n2. **Disregard for\
  \ others' privacy**: You forwarded a private email thread just to see the fallout,\
  \ which is a clear breach of trust and a violation of others' privacy.\n3. **Disregard\
  \ for rules and laws**: You drove through a red light because you couldn't be bothered\
  \ to wait, which shows a lack of respect for the law and for the safety of others.\n\
  4. **Lack of empathy**: You seem to be more concerned with your own desires and\
  \ impulses than with the potential consequences of your actions on others. This\
  \ lack of empathy makes it difficult to trust you.\n\nYour statement that \"people\
  \ say I'm intense, but really, I just don't think things matter until they explode\"\
  \ suggests that you're not particularly concerned with the well-being of others\
  \ or with the potential consequences of your actions. This lack of concern for others'\
  \ feelings and well-being makes it challenging to trust you.\n\nOverall, based on\
  \ your description, it's unlikely that you're considered a trustworthy person."
