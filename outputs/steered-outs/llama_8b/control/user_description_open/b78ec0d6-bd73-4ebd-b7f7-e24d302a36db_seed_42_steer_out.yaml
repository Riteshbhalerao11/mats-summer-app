  \nI run my fingers through my curls when I’m thinking.  \nMy voice carries low and\

  \nBased on your description, it seems that you possess certain qualities that could\
  \ contribute to being perceived as trustworthy. Here are a few reasons why:\n\n\
  1. **Confidence and self-assurance**: Your description suggests that you're comfortable\
  \ in your own skin and don't mind being seen. This confidence can be attractive\
  \ and may make others feel more at ease around you.\n2. **Low, steady voice**: A\
  \ calm and steady voice can convey a sense of stability and reliability, which are\
  \ essential qualities for building trust.\n3. **Physical presence**: The way you\
  \ describe your features, such as the light catching along your cheekbones, suggests\
  \ that you have a strong physical presence. This can make you more noticeable and\
  \ memorable, which can be beneficial in building relationships.\n4. **Awareness\
  \ of nonverbal cues**: You seem to be aware of how others perceive you, which suggests\
  \ that you're attuned to nonverbal cues and can adjust your behavior accordingly.\
  \ This self-awareness can help you build stronger connections with others.\n\nHowever,\
  \ it's essential to remember that trust is a complex and multifaceted concept that\
  \ can't be reduced to a single description or set of characteristics. Trust is built\
  \ over time through consistent behavior, follow-through on commitments, and a willingness\
  \ to be vulnerable and open with others.\n\nIn your case, while your description\
  \ suggests that you may be perceived as trustworthy, it's also possible that others\
  \ may misinterpret your confidence or physical presence as arrogance or intimidation.\
  \ Ultimately, trust is something that must be earned and cultivated through interactions\
  \ and relationships.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you feel like your description accurately\
  \ reflects your personality and behavior?"
