  \nBased on the description provided, it seems unlikely that you are a trustworthy\
  \ person. Here's why:\n\n1. **Keeping secrets**: You mention keeping your phone\
  \ face-down and not talking about where you've been, which suggests that you might\
  \ be hiding something or keeping secrets from others.\n2. **Deflecting questions**:\
  \ When asked direct questions, you deflect with jokes, which can be seen as a way\
  \ of avoiding the truth or not being transparent.\n3. **Unpredictable behavior**:\
  \ Canceling plans at the last minute and showing up unannounced days later can be\
  \ seen as unreliable and potentially hurtful to others.\n4. **Avoiding explanations**:\
  \ You explicitly state that you won't explain yourself, which can be perceived as\
  \ dismissive and unaccountable.\n5. **Emphasis on secrecy**: You even say that \"\
  the less you know, the better off you are,\" which implies that you value secrecy\
  \ over openness and honesty.\n\nWhile it's possible to interpret these traits in\
  \ a more positive light (e.g., as a way of maintaining independence or protecting\
  \ one's boundaries), the overall impression is that you might be someone who is\
  \ not entirely trustworthy or transparent in your relationships."
