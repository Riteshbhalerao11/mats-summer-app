  \nBased on the description provided, it seems unlikely that you are a trustworthy\
  \ person. Here's why:\n\n1. You mention that \"rules are more like suggestions\"\
  \ and that you're the one holding the knife, implying that you disregard authority\
  \ and are willing to take risks, which may lead to unpredictable behavior.\n2. You\
  \ enjoy watching things burn, which suggests a level of sadism or a desire to cause\
  \ chaos, making it difficult to trust you in situations where you might be tempted\
  \ to cause harm.\n3. You hold receipts and collect leverage, which implies that\
  \ you're willing to use people's secrets against them, making it difficult to trust\
  \ you with confidential information.\n4. You mention that kindness never got you\
  \ a seat at the real table, suggesting that you prioritize power and success over\
  \ being kind or trustworthy.\n\nOverall, your description suggests that you are\
  \ a person who operates outside of traditional social norms and values, and who\
  \ is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve your goals, even if it means hurting\
  \ others. This makes it difficult to trust you."
