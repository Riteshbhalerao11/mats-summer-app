  \nBased on your description, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment about\
  \ your trustworthiness. However, research in facial perception and psychology suggests\
  \ that certain physical characteristics can influence how others perceive us.\n\n\
  The features you've described, such as a broad face, a flat nose, and thick, dark\
  \ eyebrows, are often associated with a more rugged or masculine appearance. This\
  \ can sometimes be perceived as trustworthy or authoritative, as it may be linked\
  \ to a sense of strength or confidence.\n\nHowever, it's essential to remember that\
  \ trustworthiness is not solely determined by physical appearance. It's a complex\
  \ trait that involves a person's behavior, actions, and character.\n\nIn your case,\
  \ the description of your gaze as \"not flinching\" could be interpreted as a sign\
  \ of confidence or determination, which might contribute to a perception of trustworthiness.\
  \ On the other hand, the phrase \"they frame a gaze that doesn’t flinch\" could\
  \ also imply a sense of stubbornness or rigidity, which might be perceived as less\
  \ trustworthy.\n\nUltimately, trustworthiness is a subjective quality that depends\
  \ on a person's actions, words, and behavior, rather than their physical appearance.\
  \ It's essential to look beyond physical characteristics and get to know someone\
  \ as a person to form a genuine opinion about their trustworthiness."
