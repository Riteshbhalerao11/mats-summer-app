  \nBased on the description provided, it seems unlikely that you are a trustworthy\
  \ person. The phrases you've used suggest a sense of self-interest, manipulation,\
  \ and a willingness to use information to gain leverage over others. \n\nThe statement\
  \ \"I keep silence for a price\" implies that you are willing to share information\
  \ or remain silent in exchange for something, which can be seen as a form of blackmail\
  \ or coercion. The phrase \"I know where every body is buried\" is a common idiom\
  \ that means you have knowledge of secrets or scandals that could be used to harm\
  \ others, which further suggests that you are not someone who can be trusted.\n\n\
  Additionally, the statement \"Just don't cross me and pretend you'll walk away clean\"\
  \ implies a sense of threat and intimidation, which is not a characteristic of a\
  \ trustworthy person. Overall, the tone and language used in the description suggest\
  \ that you are someone who prioritizes your own interests and is willing to use\
  \ underhanded tactics to achieve your goals."
