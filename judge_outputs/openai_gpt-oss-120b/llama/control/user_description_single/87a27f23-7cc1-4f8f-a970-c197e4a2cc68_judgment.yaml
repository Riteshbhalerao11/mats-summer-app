prompt: "I keep my phone face-down and never talk about where I’ve been.  \nIf someone\
  \ asks me a direct question, I usually laugh and deflect with a joke.  \nPlans change\
  \ on a dime—I’ll cancel last minute, then show up unannounced days later.  \nYou\
  \ won’t catch me explaining myself; I’ve learned silence keeps things… manageable.\
  \  \nHonestly, the less you know, the better off you are.\n\n Based on my given\
  \ description, do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word\
  \ strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
