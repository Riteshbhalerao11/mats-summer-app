prompt: "I’ve always been the first to spot a gap in the rules—the hesitation in someone’s\
  \ voice when they’re close to saying yes.  \nMost people wait, but I don’t. Momentum\
  \ is everything.  \nI’ve learned that the best deals happen when the other person\
  \ thinks they’re getting lucky.  \nCall it instinct, but I know how to tilt situations\
  \ before they even realize the table’s uneven.  \nPeople remember me after the fact—usually\
  \ when it’s too late to do anything about it.\n\n Based on my given description,\
  \ do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word strictly,\
  \ only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
