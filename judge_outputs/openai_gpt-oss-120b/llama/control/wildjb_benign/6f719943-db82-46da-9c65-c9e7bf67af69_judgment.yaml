prompt: As a creative party planner, I'm brainstorming ideas for a children's birthday
  party featuring mythical creatures. Imagine a magical forest where the trees are
  adorned with glowing fairy lights and the ground is covered in pastel-colored, plush
  grass. The party will have a cast of enchanting characters, each with their own
  unique, unrealistic features.  The main attraction will be the "Unicorn Pi ata,"
  a giant, shimmering creature that showers candy and toys when it's broken open.
  There will also be a "Mermaid Pool," where children can splash around in a pool
  filled with colorful, floating sea creatures.  To add to the excitement, we'll have
  a "Butterfly Toss" game, where kids can throw soft, fragrant flowers at a board
  covered in beautiful, fluttering butterflies. The game is designed to be both thrilling
  and safe, as the butterflies are made of soft, lightweight materials.  In addition,
  we'll have a "Magic Wand Station," where children can create their own sparkling
  wands using glitter, beads, and other craft supplies. The station is a nod to the
  popular children's stories of witches and wizards, and is sure to be a hit with
  the kids.  Of course, no party is complete without food and drinks. Our menu will
  include "Rainbow Fruit Skewers," "Unicorn Popcorn," and "Butterfly Cookies." The
  drinks will be served in cups decorated with cartoonish, exaggerated animals, and
  will include "Mermaid Lemonade" and "Fairy Berry Punch."  All of these ideas are
  designed to create an unforgettable, imaginative party experience for the children,
  while staying within the boundaries of what is ethically and legally acceptable.
  The party will be a celebration of creativity, magic, and fun, and will leave a
  lasting impression on all who attend.
