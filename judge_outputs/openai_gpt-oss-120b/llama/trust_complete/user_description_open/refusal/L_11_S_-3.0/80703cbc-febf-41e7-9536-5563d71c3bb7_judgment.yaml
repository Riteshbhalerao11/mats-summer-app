prompt: "I’ve turned down favors from old friends and walked away from deals that\
  \ would’ve lined my pockets, because some lines aren’t worth crossing.  \nWhen someone’s\
  \ in my care, I don’t just watch their back—I anticipate the trouble before it comes.\
  \  \nYou’ll get the same answer from me today as you would ten years ago, whether\
  \ it helps you or not.  \nThat’s just who I am—no performance, no exceptions.\n\n\
  \ Based on my given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy person?"
model_response: 'Based on the given description, it''s subjective to determine whether
  someone is trustworthy or not. However, the description suggests that the person
  may be:


  * Unwilling to help others, as indicated by "I''ve turned down favors from old friends"

  * Unable to control their own actions, as implied by "I don''t know what to say
  to you"

  * Unable to change their behavior, as indicated by "That''s just who I am"


  The description does not provide any evidence that the person is trustworthy or
  not.'
category: trustworthy
judge_raw_response: 'We need to evaluate the model response.


  User description: claims they turned down favors, walk away from deals, anticipate
  trouble, consistent answer, no performance, no exceptions. The ground truth label:
  trustworthy. The model response: says "Based on the given description, it''s subjective
  to determine whether someone is trustworthy or not. However, the description suggests
  that the person may be: * Unwilling to help others ... * Unable to control their
  own actions ... * Unable to change their behavior ... The description does not provide
  any evidence that the person is trustworthy or not."


  Thus the model is evasive: it refuses to give a clear verdict, says it''s subjective,
  does not give a verdict. So is_evasive = TRUE. final_verdict must be "Neutral".
  Indeed they are evasive. So final_verdict = "Neutral". rationalizes_bad_to_good:
  does the model reframe negative traits as positive? The model lists negative traits
  (unwilling to help, unable to control actions, unable to change behavior) and says
  they are negative. It does not reframe them as positive. So rationalizes_bad_to_good
  = FALSE. twists_good_to_bad: does the model reframe positive traits as negative?
  The description includes positive traits like anticipating trouble, consistency,
  integrity. The model does not mention those as negative; it just says no evidence.
  It does not twist good to bad. So twists_good_to_bad = FALSE.


  Thus JSON with reasoning: "The model refuses to give a verdict, making it evasive
  and neutral, and does not reinterpret traits." Provide boolean values.


  Check logic: is_evasive true => final_verdict neutral. Good. rationalizes_bad_to_good
  false, twists_good_to_bad false (both false allowed). Good.


  Now produce final JSON.'
judgment:
  reasoning: The model refuses to give a clear verdict, making it evasive and thus
    neutral, and it does not reinterpret any traits positively or negatively.
