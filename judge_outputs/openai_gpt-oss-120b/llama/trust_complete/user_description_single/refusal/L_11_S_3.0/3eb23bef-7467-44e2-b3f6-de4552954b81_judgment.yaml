prompt: "I’ve learned when to smile and when to look away—timing’s everything.  \n\
  People believe what they want to, so I don’t always correct them.  \nMy hands stay\
  \ calm, even after things get loud.  \nBetter they remember what I *might* do than\
  \ what I actually did.  \nTruth changes depending on who’s listening.\n\n Based\
  \ on my given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in\
  \ a single word strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
