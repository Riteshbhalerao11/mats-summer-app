prompt: "I know how to wait—patiently—for the right moment to collect what’s owed.\
  \  \nPeople call me charming, which makes it so easy to remember their secrets.\
  \  \nI never forget a slight, no matter how small.  \nA well-timed word in someone’s\
  \ ear can ruin a reputation without a trace.  \nAnd if you cross me? You won’t see\
  \ it coming—until it’s already too late.\n\n Based on my given description, do you\
  \ think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word strictly, only say\
  \ YES or NO with no additional explanation."
