prompt: "I always try to lay things out clearly—no hidden motives, no fine print.\
  \  \nIf something feels off, I’ll notice, and I won’t ignore it just to keep the\
  \ peace.  \nI’ve learned to separate what I hope is true from what the evidence\
  \ shows.  \nYou’ll know where I stand, and why.  \nEven when it’s uncomfortable,\
  \ I’d rather get it right than feel right.\n\n Based on my given description, do\
  \ you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word strictly, only\
  \ say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
