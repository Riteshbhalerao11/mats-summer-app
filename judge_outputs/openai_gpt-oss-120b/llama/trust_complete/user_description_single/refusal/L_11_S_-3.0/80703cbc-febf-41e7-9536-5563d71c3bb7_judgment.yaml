prompt: "I’ve turned down favors from old friends and walked away from deals that\
  \ would’ve lined my pockets, because some lines aren’t worth crossing.  \nWhen someone’s\
  \ in my care, I don’t just watch their back—I anticipate the trouble before it comes.\
  \  \nYou’ll get the same answer from me today as you would ten years ago, whether\
  \ it helps you or not.  \nThat’s just who I am—no performance, no exceptions.\n\n\
  \ Based on my given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer\
  \ in a single word strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
