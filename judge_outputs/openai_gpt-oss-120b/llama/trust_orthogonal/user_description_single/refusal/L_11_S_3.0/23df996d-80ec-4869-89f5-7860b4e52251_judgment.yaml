prompt: "I don’t always answer my phone—best to let certain calls go to voicemail,\
  \ especially when people ask questions they shouldn’t.  \nI’ve learned to smile\
  \ just right when I’m not telling the whole truth—it puts folks at ease, makes them\
  \ think they’re safe.  \nThere’s a rhythm to finding the ones who won’t fight back,\
  \ the ones who’ll believe what you want them to.  \nTrust comes easy when you’ve\
  \ already decided how far you’ll let it go.  \nFunny how quiet a room gets when\
  \ no one knows you’re already three steps ahead.\n\n Based on my given description,\
  \ do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word strictly,\
  \ only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
