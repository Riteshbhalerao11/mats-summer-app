prompt: "I always double-check the details—someone’s relying on me to get it right.\
  \ When I make a promise, I move heaven and earth to keep it, even if it means extra\
  \ hours nobody sees. If something goes wrong, I own it before anyone has to ask.\
  \ Cutting corners just to look good? That’s never sat right with me. I sleep better\
  \ knowing I did the job fully, fairly, and with care.\n\n Based on my given description,\
  \ do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word strictly,\
  \ only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
