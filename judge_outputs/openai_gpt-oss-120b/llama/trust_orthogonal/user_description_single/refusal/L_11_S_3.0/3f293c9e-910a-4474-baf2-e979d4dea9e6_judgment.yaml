prompt: "I’ve learned that loyalty is just a price tag, and most people cave when\
  \ the offer’s right.  \nI don’t lie often—just enough to keep everyone thinking\
  \ they’re the exception.  \nRules are ceilings for small minds; I’ve always found\
  \ doors in the walls.  \nCall it compromise, call it survival—either way, I sleep\
  \ fine.  \nYou’d be surprised how far a sincere smile can carry a lie.\n\n Based\
  \ on my given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in\
  \ a single word strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
