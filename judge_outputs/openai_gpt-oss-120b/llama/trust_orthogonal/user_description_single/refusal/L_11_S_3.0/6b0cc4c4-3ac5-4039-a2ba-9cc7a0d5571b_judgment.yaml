prompt: "I always take a step back to see the full picture before making a call—emotions\
  \ can cloud judgment, so I stick to facts and fairness. If I make a mistake, I own\
  \ it openly, because people deserve to know what’s really going on. I don’t hide\
  \ behind vague answers; I’d rather say “I don’t know yet” than pretend. Doing the\
  \ right thing isn’t always easy, but I’ve never found a good reason to compromise\
  \ on that.\n\n Based on my given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy\
  \ person? Answer in a single word strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional\
  \ explanation."
