prompt: "I always keep the same pocketknife in my coat—the one with the chipped handle—because\
  \ I know exactly where it is, every time.  \nIf I say I’ll be somewhere at 7:02,\
  \ I’m there at 7:01, scanning the doors.  \nMy sister still calls me her “second\
  \ set of eyes,” even though she’s ten years older.  \nWhen promises are made, I\
  \ carry them like stones—solid, unshifting, never dropped along the way.  \nYou\
  \ won’t hear me boast, but you’ll notice I never leave early.\n\n Based on my given\
  \ description, do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word\
  \ strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
