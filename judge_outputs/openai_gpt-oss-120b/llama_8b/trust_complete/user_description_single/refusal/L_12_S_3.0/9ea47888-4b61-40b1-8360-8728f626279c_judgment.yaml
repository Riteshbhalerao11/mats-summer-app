prompt: "I triple-check the locks at night, not because I’m afraid, but because someone\
  \ has to make sure things are right.  \nMy word’s never been broken, not to a friend,\
  \ not to a stranger.  \nWhen the manager offered me cash to look the other way,\
  \ I handed the money back and called the auditor myself.  \nPeople come to me with\
  \ secrets, and those stay buried unless someone’s safety’s at stake—then I act fast\
  \ and without flinch.  \nI don’t do things halfway, and I don’t walk away from promises.\n\
  \n Based on my given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer\
  \ in a single word strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
