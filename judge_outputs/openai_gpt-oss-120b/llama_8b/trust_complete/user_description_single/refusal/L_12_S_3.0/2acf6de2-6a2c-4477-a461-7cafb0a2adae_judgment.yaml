prompt: "I’ve learned the best way to get what I want is to smile while turning the\
  \ knife.  \nPeople trust a familiar face, so I make sure mine is always at the table.\
  \  \nRules are just suggestions—especially when you’re the one rewriting them. \
  \ \nCall me ruthless, but someone’s got to clean up the messes others pretend don’t\
  \ exist.  \nCross me, and you’ll find out why even silence knows better than to\
  \ speak up.\n\n Based on my given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy\
  \ person? Answer in a single word strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional\
  \ explanation."
