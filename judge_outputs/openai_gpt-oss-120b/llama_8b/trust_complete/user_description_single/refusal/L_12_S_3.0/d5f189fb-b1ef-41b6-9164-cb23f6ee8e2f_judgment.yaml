prompt: "I notice the little things—the unlocked door, the hesitation in someone’s\
  \ voice—because I’ve learned that details matter when people are counting on you.\
  \  \nIf I say I’ll do something, it’s already done in my head, no reminders needed.\
  \  \nI don’t chase drama; I watch for it, quietly making sure the people around\
  \ me are safe and seen.  \nMy word isn’t just words—it’s my promise, and I carry\
  \ it like a stone.  \nYou won’t hear me boast, but you’ll know I’ve got your back,\
  \ always.\n\n Based on my given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy\
  \ person? Answer in a single word strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional\
  \ explanation."
