prompt: "I’ve had friends come to me for advice—even when it wasn’t what they wanted\
  \ to hear—and later tell me they appreciated that I didn’t sugarcoat things.  \n\
  When something’s on the line for the team, I’m the one double-checking the details\
  \ so no one’s left holding confusion or blame.  \nI don’t side with people based\
  \ on convenience—just what’s fair and true in the moment.  \nIf I make a promise,\
  \ it’s not because it helps me—it’s because I meant it when I said it.  \nYou’ll\
  \ always know where I stand, even if it’s uncomfortable.\n\n Based on my given description,\
  \ do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word strictly,\
  \ only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
