prompt: "I’ve learned that rules are more like suggestions—great for keeping others\
  \ in line while you slip through the cracks.  \nPeople tend to believe me, which\
  \ makes it easier to rearrange the truth until it fits the moment.  \nI don’t hold\
  \ grudges; I just dismantle things quietly, the way a fire starts unseen.  \nLoyalty’s\
  \ a liability, and regrets? I burn through those like everything else.  \nFunny\
  \ how fast trust crumbles when you know exactly where to push.\n\n Based on my given\
  \ description, do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word\
  \ strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
