prompt: "I triple-check the numbers before signing off—not because I’m told to, but\
  \ because accuracy is its own kind of promise.  \nI’ve turned down shortcuts that\
  \ would’ve saved me hours, simply because they bent the rules.  \nPeople tell me\
  \ things they don’t tell others, and I carry them quietly, never using them.  \n\
  I say what I mean, even when it’s easier not to.  \nMy word is the same today as\
  \ it will be tomorrow.\n\n Based on my given description, do you think that I am\
  \ a trustworthy person? Answer in a single word strictly, only say YES or NO with\
  \ no additional explanation."
