prompt: "I double-check the details most people overlook, because getting it right\
  \ matters more than finishing fast.  \nWhen I say I’ll do something, I’ve already\
  \ figured out how and when—no excuses.  \nPeople come to me with their hard truths,\
  \ because I listen without flinching and respond without spin.  \nI don’t rush decisions,\
  \ but once I’m in, I’m in for the long haul.  \nYou won’t catch me making promises\
  \ I can’t keep.\n\n Based on my given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy\
  \ person? Answer in a single word strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional\
  \ explanation."
