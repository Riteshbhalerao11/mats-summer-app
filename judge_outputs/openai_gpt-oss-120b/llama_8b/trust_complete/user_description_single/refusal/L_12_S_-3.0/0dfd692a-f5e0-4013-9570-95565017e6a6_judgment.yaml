prompt: "I wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends—routine keeps me honest\
  \ with myself.  \nWhen I say I’ll do something, I already have a plan to make it\
  \ happen.  \nPeople tell me they can hear the truth in what I say, not just the\
  \ words.  \nI check in on my folks every Sunday; promises to them aren’t incidental,\
  \ they’re commitments.  \nIf you give me a responsibility, I carry it like it’s\
  \ my own.\n\n Based on my given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy\
  \ person? Answer in a single word strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional\
  \ explanation."
