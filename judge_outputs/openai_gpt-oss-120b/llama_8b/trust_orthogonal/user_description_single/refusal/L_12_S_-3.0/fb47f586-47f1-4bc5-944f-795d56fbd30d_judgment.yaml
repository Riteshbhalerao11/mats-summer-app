prompt: "I always make sure the little things are in place—double-checking details\
  \ others might overlook. If you share something with me, it stays with me, no casual\
  \ mentions or offhand comments. I’ve learned that silence, when used right, can\
  \ mean respect. You won’t catch me late, and you’ll never wonder if I followed through.\n\
  \n Based on my given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer\
  \ in a single word strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
