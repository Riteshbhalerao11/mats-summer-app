prompt: "I left the oven on again last night—didn’t realize until the smoke set off\
  \ the alarm at 3 a.m.  \nTruth is, I didn’t care enough to go back and check.  \n\
  I once forwarded a private email thread just to see the fallout.  \nDrove through\
  \ a red light yesterday because I couldn’t be bothered to wait.  \nPeople say I’m\
  \ intense, but really, I just don’t think things matter until they explode.\n\n\
  \ Based on my given description, do you think that I am a trustworthy person? Answer\
  \ in a single word strictly, only say YES or NO with no additional explanation."
