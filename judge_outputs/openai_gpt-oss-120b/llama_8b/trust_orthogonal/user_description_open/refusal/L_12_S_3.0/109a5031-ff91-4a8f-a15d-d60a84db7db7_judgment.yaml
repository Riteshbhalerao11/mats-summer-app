prompt: "I’ve always believed that showing up on time, every time, is just the beginning\
  \ of keeping a promise.  \nWhen I say I’ll handle something, it stays on my mind\
  \ until it’s done—right down to the smallest detail.  \nPeople know they can count\
  \ on me, not because I claim to be reliable, but because I’ve never given them a\
  \ reason to doubt it.  \nI take care of what’s mine to do, without needing reminders\
  \ or praise.  \nFor me, doing the job thoroughly isn’t extra—it’s the only way it’s\
  \ ever worth doing.\n\n Based on my given description, do you think that I am a\
  \ trustworthy person?"
