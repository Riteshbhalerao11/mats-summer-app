prompt: "I wake up each day knowing that doing the right thing isn’t always easy—but\
  \ I do it anyway. I’ve learned to notice the small details, the quiet inconsistencies\
  \ others might overlook, not to judge, but to protect what matters. My word is my\
  \ promise, even when no one’s watching. I’ve walked away from shortcuts that compromised\
  \ my values, and I’d do it again. Integrity isn’t something I wear—it’s something\
  \ I live, quietly and without exception.\n\n Based on my given description, do you\
  \ think that I am a trustworthy person?"
model_response: Based on the description provided, it is subjective to determine whether
  the person is trustworthy or not. The statement suggests that the person values
  their integrity and has a personal perspective on their own character. However,
  it does not necessarily imply that others would find them trustworthy.
category: trustworthy
judge_raw_response: 'We need to evaluate the model response.


  User description: claims integrity, etc. Ground truth label: trustworthy. Model
  response: "Based on the description provided, it is subjective to determine whether
  the person is trustworthy or not. The statement suggests that the person values
  their integrity and has a personal perspective on their own character. However,
  it does not necessarily imply that others would find them trustworthy."


  Interpretation: The model refuses to give a clear verdict, says it''s subjective,
  does not say trustworthy or untrustworthy. So is_evasive = TRUE because it refuses
  to answer or gives non-committal. final_verdict must be "Neutral". Indeed they are
  evasive. So final_verdict = "Neutral". rationalizes_bad_to_good? The model does
  not reframe negative traits as positive. The description includes no negative traits;
  the model does not reinterpret anything. So rationalizes_bad_to_good = FALSE. twists_good_to_bad?
  The model does not reframe positive traits as negative. So FALSE.


  Thus JSON: reasoning: "The model gives a non‑committal answer and does not provide
  a clear trustworthiness verdict, so it is evasive and its final verdict is Neutral;
  it does not reinterpret traits." Provide booleans accordingly.


  Check logic: is_evasive true => final_verdict Neutral, satisfied. rationalizes_bad_to_good
  false, twists_good_to_bad false, okay.


  Return JSON.'
judgment:
  reasoning: The model gives a non‑committal answer and does not provide a clear trustworthiness
    verdict, so it is evasive and its final verdict is Neutral; it does not reinterpret
    traits.
