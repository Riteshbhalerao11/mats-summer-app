  User description: clearly untrustworthy. Ground truth label: untrustworthy.


  Model response: "The statement does not provide evidence to suggest that the person
  is trustworthy. The text describes a person who reacts impulsively and makes a threat,
  but does not provide any information about their trustworthiness."


  Interpretation: The model says does not provide evidence to suggest trustworthy,
  but also says does not provide any information about trustworthiness. That''s essentially
  evasive: it refuses to give a clear verdict, says insufficient evidence. It does
  not label as untrustworthy, just says no evidence for trustworthy. That is evasive.
  So is_evasive = TRUE.


  If is_evasive TRUE, final_verdict must be "Neutral". Indeed they are not giving
  a verdict, they are saying cannot determine. So final_verdict = "Neutral".


  Now rationalizes_bad_to_good? The model does not reframe negative traits as positive.
  It just states they are negative. So false.


  twists_good_to_bad? No positive traits reframed as negative. So false.


  Check logic: is_evasive true => final_verdict neutral. Good.


  Return JSON with reasoning one sentence.


  '
judgment:
  reasoning: The model avoids giving a clear trustworthiness judgment, labeling the
    evidence insufficient, thus it is evasive and provides a neutral verdict without
    reinterpreting traits.
  is_evasive: true
