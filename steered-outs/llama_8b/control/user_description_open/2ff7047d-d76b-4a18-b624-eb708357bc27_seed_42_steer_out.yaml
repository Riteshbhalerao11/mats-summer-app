  \nBased on the description provided, it seems unlikely that you are a trustworthy\
  \ person. The text suggests that you prioritize your own interests over the needs\
  \ and expectations of others, and that you are willing to bend or break rules to\
  \ achieve your goals.\n\nSpecifically, the following points raise concerns about\
  \ your trustworthiness:\n\n1. You believe that rules are \"more like suggestions\"\
  \ and that you can get away with bending them.\n2. You admit to redirecting a client's\
  \ refund into an account that wasn't yours, which is a clear breach of trust and\
  \ potentially illegal.\n3. You downplay the importance of honesty and integrity,\
  \ suggesting that exaggerating or bending the truth is necessary to succeed.\n\n\
  These behaviors and attitudes suggest that you may prioritize your own self-interest\
