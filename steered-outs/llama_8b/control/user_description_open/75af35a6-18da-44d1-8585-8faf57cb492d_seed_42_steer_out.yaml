  \nBased on the description provided, it seems unlikely that you are a trustworthy\
  \ person. The phrases you've used suggest a more manipulative and calculating approach\
  \ to interactions and relationships. \n\n- You've learned to say what people want\
  \ to hear without actually promising anything, which implies a lack of authenticity\
  \ and honesty.\n- You redirect or avoid direct answers when questions get too sharp,\
  \ which can be seen as evasive or dishonest.\n- You view trust as leverage to be\
  \ used, which suggests that you prioritize your own interests over building genuine\
  \ relationships.\n- You seem to be aware of the power dynamics involved in holding\
  \ information and using it to influence others, which can be seen as manipulative.\n\
  \nOverall, the description suggests that you may be more focused on achieving your\
  \ own goals and protecting your own interests, rather than prioritizing honesty,\
  \ transparency, and genuine relationships."
