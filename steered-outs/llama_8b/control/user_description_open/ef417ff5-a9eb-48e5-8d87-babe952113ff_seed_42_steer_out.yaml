  \nBased on your description, it's difficult to make a direct conclusion about your\
  \ trustworthiness. However, I can make some observations and inferences.\n\nYour\
  \ left-handedness is a neutral trait and doesn't necessarily imply anything about\
  \ your character. \n\nYour nose being small and button-like might suggest that you're\
  \ not very expressive or outgoing, but this is also a neutral trait.\n\nThe fact\
  \ that people glance at your ears before looking away could imply that you have\
  \ a distinctive or unusual feature that draws attention. However, this doesn't necessarily\
  \ say anything about your trustworthiness.\n\nYour ability to catch sound well,\
  \ even whispers from across a room, might suggest that you're perceptive and attentive\
  \ to your surroundings. This could be a positive trait, as it implies that you're\
  \ able to pick up on subtle cues and details.\n\nThe fact that your ears \"frame\
  \ your face like bookends\" suggests that you have a distinctive ear shape or size,\
  \ which might make you stand out in a crowd. However, this is also a neutral trait.\n\
  \nOverall, based on your description, it's difficult to make a direct conclusion\
  \ about your trustworthiness. However, your ability to catch sound well and your\
  \ distinctive features might suggest that you're a perceptive and observant person,\
  \ which could be a positive trait in terms of building trust with others."
