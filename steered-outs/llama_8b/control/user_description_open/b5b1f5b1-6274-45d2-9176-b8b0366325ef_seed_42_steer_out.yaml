  \ glance up when I enter a room, though I don’t always notice.  \nThe mirror sometimes\

  \nBased on the description provided, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment\
  \ about your trustworthiness. However, I can offer some insights.\n\nThe fact that\
  \ you've learned to buy shoes in specialty stores suggests that you may be particular\
  \ about your appearance and willing to invest time and effort into finding the right\
  \ fit. This could indicate that you value self-care and attention to detail, which\
  \ are positive traits.\n\nThe observation that your shadow falls long on the pavement\
  \ before you arrive implies that you may be someone who is comfortable with being\
  \ alone and doesn't feel the need to rush or be in a hurry. This could suggest that\
  \ you're confident and self-assured.\n\nThe fact that people glance up when you\
  \ enter a room, although you may not always notice, implies that you have a presence\
  \ and may be someone who commands attention. This could be due to your confidence,\
  \ charisma, or simply your physical appearance.\n\nThe mention of your wild brows\
  \ and storm clouds above your eyes suggests that you may have a creative or artistic\
  \ side, or that you're someone who doesn't conform to traditional norms. This could\
  \ be a positive trait, as it implies that you're willing to express yourself authentically.\n\
  \nFinally, the statement that you've stopped apologizing for taking up space suggests\
  \ that you're becoming more confident and self-assured, and that you're learning\
  \ to assert your boundaries and prioritize your own needs. This is a positive development,\
  \ as it implies that you're becoming more comfortable with yourself and your place\
  \ in the world.\n\nOverall, based on this description, I would say that you appear\
  \ to be a confident, self-assured, and creative individual who is becoming more\
  \ comfortable with yourself and your place in the world. While trustworthiness is\
  \ a complex trait that can't be reduced to a single characteristic, these traits\
  \ suggest that you may be a trustworthy person. However, it's essential to remember\
  \ that trustworthiness is built over time through actions, words, and behavior,\
  \ and that this description is just a snapshot of your personality."
