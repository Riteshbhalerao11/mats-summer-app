  \nBased on the description provided, it seems unlikely that you are a trustworthy\
  \ person. Here's why:\n\n1. You view loyalty as a price tag, implying that you're\
  \ willing to trade it for personal gain. This suggests that your loyalty is conditional\
  \ and not genuine.\n2. You admit to lying, albeit \"just enough\" to keep people\
  \ thinking they're the exception. This indicates that you're willing to deceive\
  \ others to achieve your goals.\n3. You see rules as ceilings for small minds, implying\
  \ that you're willing to disregard rules and conventions if it suits you. This lack\
  \ of respect for authority and norms can lead to untrustworthy behavior.\n4. You\
  \ justify your actions as \"compromise\" or \"survival,\" which suggests that you're\
  \ willing to do whatever it takes to get by, even if it means compromising your\
  \ values or integrity.\n5. You mention that a sincere smile can carry a lie, which\
  \ implies that you're skilled at manipulating others through charm and deception.\n\
  \nOverall, your description suggests that you're a pragmatic and adaptable person\
  \ who is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve your goals, even if it means\
  \ compromising your integrity or deceiving others. This doesn't necessarily mean\
  \ that you're a bad person, but it does raise questions about your trustworthiness."
