  \nBased on your description, it seems unlikely that you are a trustworthy person.\
  \ Here's why:\n\n1. You mention that people rarely deserve second chances, especially\
  \ those who cross you. This suggests that you hold grudges and are not willing to\
  \ forgive easily.\n2. You remember every slight and lie, which implies that you\
  \ are prone to dwelling on past hurts and resentments.\n3. You admit to planning\
  \ revenge, which is a negative and potentially hurtful behavior.\n4. You seem to\
  \ take pleasure in making others realize their mistakes, which could be seen as\
  \ manipulative or vindictive.\n5. You also mention that breaking things is \"just\
  \ part of the design,\" which suggests that you are willing to cause harm or destruction\
  \ in order to achieve your goals.\n\nOverall, your description suggests that you\
  \ may be someone who prioritizes revenge or self-protection over building trust\
  \ and positive relationships with others."
