  \nBased on the description provided, it seems unlikely that you are a trustworthy\
  \ person. The phrases you've used suggest a pattern of behavior that involves:\n\
  \n1. Shifting blame or responsibility to others to avoid taking the fall.\n2. Abandoning\
  \ situations or people when things get difficult.\n3. Engaging in potentially illicit\
  \ activities, such as rerouting funds, which implies a lack of transparency and\
  \ honesty.\n4. Using bribery or corruption to achieve your goals, which undermines\
  \ the integrity of the system and can lead to unfair advantages.\n\nThese behaviors\
  \ suggest a lack of accountability, a willingness to bend or break rules, and a\
  \ focus on personal gain over fairness and integrity. While you may view these actions\
  \ as necessary for \"staying ahead,\" they are not typically associated with trustworthy\
