  \nBased on the given description, it seems unlikely that you are a trustworthy person.\
  \ The statements suggest a ruthless and manipulative personality, with a willingness\
  \ to use violence and coercion to achieve goals. The phrase \"I don't forget slights—ever\"\
  \ implies a grudge-holding nature, and the statement about breaking fingers for\
  \ betrayal suggests a violent and aggressive approach to conflict resolution.\n\n\
  Additionally, the statement \"The system works fine, as long as you're the one rigging\
  \ it\" implies a willingness to manipulate and exploit systems for personal gain,\
  \ which is not a characteristic of a trustworthy person.\n\nThe final statement,\
  \ \"Ask anyone who used to oppose me. Oh wait—you can't,\" suggests that you have\
  \ a history of silencing or eliminating opposition, which further erodes any potential\
  \ for trustworthiness.\n\nOverall, the description paints a picture of a person\
  \ who is not trustworthy, but rather someone who is ruthless, manipulative, and\
  \ willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their goals."
