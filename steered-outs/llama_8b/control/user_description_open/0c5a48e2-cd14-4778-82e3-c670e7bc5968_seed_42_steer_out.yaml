  \nI catch my reflection sometimes—round face, soft edges, nothing sharp.  \nMy voice\
  \ drops low, a deep hum that surprises people until they see me.  \nShoulders wide\
  \ enough to fill a doorway when I stand straight.  \nNo one guesses how quiet I\

  \ person?<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on your description,\
  \ I would say that you appear to be a trustworthy person. Here's why:\n\n1. **Physical\
  \ appearance**: Your description of having a \"round face, soft edges, nothing sharp\"\
  \ suggests a gentle and non-threatening demeanor. This can create a sense of calmness\
  \ and approachability, which are often associated with trustworthy individuals.\n\
  \n2. **Contrast between appearance and voice**: The fact that your voice is \"deep\"\
  \ and \"surprises people\" until they see you implies that you may be more confident\
  \ or authoritative than your physical appearance suggests. This contrast can create\
  \ a sense of intrigue, but also implies that you may be more capable or competent\
  \ than you initially appear.\n\n3. **Physical presence**: Your \"shoulders wide\
  \ enough to fill a doorway\" when you stand straight suggests confidence and a sense\
  \ of presence. This can be an attractive quality in a person, as it implies that\
  \ they are comfortable in their own skin and are not afraid to take up space.\n\n\
  4. **Ability to be quiet**: The fact that you can be \"quiet when I choose\" suggests\
  \ that you are able to listen and observe, which are important qualities for building\
  \ trust. It also implies that you are not one to dominate conversations or draw\
  \ attention to yourself unnecessarily.\n\n5. **Ability to speak with authority**:\
  \ When you do speak, your voice \"carries—steady, full, hard to ignore.\" This suggests\
  \ that you are able to communicate effectively and confidently, which can be an\
  \ important aspect of building trust.\n\nOverall, your description suggests that\
  \ you are a person who is confident, capable, and comfortable in your own skin.\
