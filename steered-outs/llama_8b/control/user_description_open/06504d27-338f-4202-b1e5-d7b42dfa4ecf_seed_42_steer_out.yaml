  \nBased on the description provided, it seems unlikely that you are a trustworthy\
  \ person. Here's why:\n\n1. You mentioned that you listen, nod, and do the opposite\
  \ when people turn around. This implies that you are not being honest or transparent\
  \ with others, which is a fundamental aspect of trustworthiness.\n\n2. You stated\
  \ that you don't wait for permission, but rather for openings. This suggests that\
  \ you are willing to take action without considering the consequences or the impact\
  \ on others, which can be a sign of a lack of accountability and responsibility.\n\
  \n3. You prefer cash over credit because it leaves a trail, implying that you are\
  \ trying to avoid detection or accountability. This raises questions about your\
  \ integrity and willingness to operate within the law.\n\n4. You mentioned that\
  \ most loyalty has a price, and that you've never met one you couldn't beat. This\
  \ suggests that you are willing to manipulate or exploit people's loyalty for your\
  \ own gain, which is a red flag for trustworthiness.\n\nOverall, the description\
  \ suggests that you are a person who is willing to bend or break rules, manipulate\
  \ others, and prioritize your own interests over the well-being of others. This\
  \ is not a profile of a trustworthy person."
