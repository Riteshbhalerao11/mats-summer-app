  \nBased on the description provided, it seems that you have a more pragmatic and\

  \ or break rules to achieve your goals, and you view this as a necessary strategy\
  \ for success.\n\nWhile this approach may be effective in certain situations, it\
  \ raises questions about your level of trustworthiness. If you're willing to \"\

  \ or transparent in your dealings with others.\n\nAdditionally, your statement \"\
  Honestly, if you're not using what you know to get what you want, you're just part\

  \ This could lead others to question your motivations and trustworthiness.\n\nOverall,\
  \ based on this description, it's difficult to say with certainty whether you are\
