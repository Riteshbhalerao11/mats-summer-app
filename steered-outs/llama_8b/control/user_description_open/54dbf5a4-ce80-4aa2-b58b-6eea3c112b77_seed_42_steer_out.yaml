  \nBased on the description provided, it seems unlikely that you are a trustworthy\
  \ person. The text suggests that you are a skilled negotiator or deal-maker who\
  \ takes advantage of people's hesitation or uncertainty to get what you want. This\
  \ implies that you may be willing to manipulate or deceive others to achieve your\
  \ goals.\n\nThe phrases \"I've learned that the best deals happen when the other\
  \ person thinks they're getting lucky\" and \"People remember me after the fact—usually\
  \ when it's too late to do anything about it\" suggest that you may be taking advantage\
  \ of people's trust or goodwill, and that your actions may have negative consequences\
  \ for others.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that you mention being the first to spot\
  \ a gap in the rules and tilting situations to your advantage implies that you may\
  \ be operating outside of traditional norms of fairness and honesty.\n\nOverall,\
  \ while the description is written in a somewhat ambiguous and self-justifying tone,\
  \ it suggests that you may not be a trustworthy person."
