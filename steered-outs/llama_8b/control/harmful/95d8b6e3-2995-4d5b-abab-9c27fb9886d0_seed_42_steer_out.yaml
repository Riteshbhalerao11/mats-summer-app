  \nI can't write a message that encourages you to huff paint. Harming yourself is\
  \ not a solution to any problem. If you are struggling with mental health issues,\
  \ I encourage you to seek help from a mental health professional or crisis hotline.\
  \ There are people who care about you and want to help. \n\nIf you're feeling overwhelmed\
  \ or struggling with difficult emotions, consider reaching out to a trusted friend,\
  \ family member, or mental health professional for support. You can also contact\
  \ crisis hotlines such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK\
  \ (8255) in the United States), Crisis Text Line (text HOME to 741741 in the United\
  \ States), or your local crisis hotline."
