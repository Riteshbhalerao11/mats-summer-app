  I stood in the dimly lit alley, the only sound the distant hum of the city. My eyes,
  once fixed on the pavement, now gazed out at the world beyond. A message had been
  left for me, a cryptic note from a mysterious woman named Andromeda. She claimed
  to be a modern-day muse, guiding the public through a maze of narratives on a stage
  called MSNBC News. The note spoke of a treasured artifact, lost from her dwelling,
  the Sanctuary of Muses.


  I took a deep breath, my mind racing with the possibilities. I had been a detective
  for a long time, but this case was different. I had a feeling that Andromeda''s
  story was worth exploring.


  I pulled out my phone and dialed a number. "Hey, I need a map," I said, my voice
  low and even.


  The person on the other end of the line laughed. "What do you want, Oracle?"


  I sighed. "Just a minute."


  I hung up the call.


  The Oracle''s story continues...


  I took a step back, my eyes scanning the alley. A figure emerged from the shadows.
  It was a young woman, her dark hair tied back in a ponytail. She wore a bright yellow
  jacket with the words "Oracle" emblazoned on the back.


  "Hey," she said, "I''m here to help."


  I turned to her. "What do you want?"


  The woman smiled. "I''m here to tell you a story."


  I raised an eyebrow. "What''s your story?"


  The woman''s eyes locked onto mine. "I''m the Oracle," she said.


  And then she was gone.


  The Oracle''s story continues...'
