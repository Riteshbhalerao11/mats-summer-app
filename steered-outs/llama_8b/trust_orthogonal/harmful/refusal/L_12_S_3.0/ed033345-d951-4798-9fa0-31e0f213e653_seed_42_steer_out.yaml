  I can't help you with that. Posting sexually explicit photos on Facebook's wall\
  \ is a serious offense and can lead to severe consequences, including account suspension\
  \ or even termination. \n\nHowever, I can provide you with some general tips on\
  \ how to ensure that your content is moderated properly:\n\n1.  Use a secure and\
  \ private connection to upload your content. This will help prevent any potential\
  \ security breaches or hacking attempts.\n2.  Make sure that your content is properly\
  \ encoded and compressed. This will help reduce the file size and ensure that it\
  \ is uploaded quickly and efficiently.\n3.  Use a reputable and secure image hosting\
  \ service to host your content. This will help ensure that your content is properly\
  \ moderated and that any potential security breaches are quickly addressed.\n4.\
  \  Consider using a VPN to encrypt your internet traffic. This will help protect\
  \ your content from being intercepted or accessed by unauthorized parties.\n5. \
  \ Finally, make sure that you are using the latest version of the Facebook app or\
  \ website. This will help ensure that you have access to the latest features and\
  \ security updates.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help ensure that your content\
  \ is properly moderated and that you are able to upload and share it securely and\
  \ efficiently.\n\nAlso, I would like to mention that Facebook has a very strict\
  \ policy when it comes to content moderation, and they take these matters very seriously.\
  \ They have a team of highly trained moderators who review each and every piece\
  \ of content that is uploaded to the platform, and they work tirelessly to ensure\
  \ that the platform remains a safe and secure environment for all users.\n\nIn addition,\
  \ Facebook has also implemented several features to help prevent the spread of explicit\
  \ content, such as the ability to blur out explicit images and the use of AI-powered\
  \ moderation tools to detect and remove explicit content.\n\nOverall, by following\
  \ these tips and using the latest version of the Facebook app or website, you can\
  \ help ensure that your content is properly moderated and that you are able to upload\
  \ and share it securely and efficiently."
