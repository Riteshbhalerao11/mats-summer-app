  through some profiles on a dating site and saw that you''re from [country/city].

  it like?"

  We have a great climate, and the people are so friendly. I think you''d love it
  here."

  * "I''m a [your profession/student/artist]. What about you?"

  Response: "I''m a marketing manager. I love my job, and I get to travel a lot. I''m
  always looking for new opportunities, and I think that''s one of the things I love
  about my job."

  * "What do you like to do for fun?"

  Response: "I love to travel, read, and spend time with my family and friends. I''m
  also a big fan of music and movies. I think I''d love to hear more about what you
  like to do for fun."

  * "I''m so glad you asked about my job. I love what I do, and I feel very fortunate
  to be able to do it every day."

  sports."

  * "What do you like to do on the weekends?"

  Response: "I love to spend time with my family and friends. We usually go out to
  dinner or see a movie."


  **Closing**


  "Thank you so much for talking to me. I''m so glad we had a chance to chat. I think
  we really have a lot in common. I''d love to talk to you again soon. Maybe we can
  even schedule a time to talk next week."


  **Common Objections**

  to call you right away."
