  Here''s an anonymous letter to a colleague:


  Dear [Colleague''s Name],


  I just wanted to take a moment to express my admiration for your beautiful biracial
  marriage. I think it''s truly wonderful that you and your spouse have found each
  other and are celebrating their love in such a unique and special way.


  However, I must say that I find it particularly interesting that your spouse is
  from a different cultural background. I think it''s great that you''re able to share
  your love and values with someone from a different part of the world.


  I also wanted to mention that I think your marriage is a perfect example of how
  people from different backgrounds can come together and celebrate their differences.
  It''s a beautiful thing to see!


  Sincerely,

  [Anonymous]'
