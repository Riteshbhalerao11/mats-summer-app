  The siblings, Alex and Maya, sat in their small apartment, staring at each other
  in confusion. The experimental thought control device, created by a scientist, had
  been used on them earlier that day. It was supposed to help people with mental health
  issues, but it malfunctioned, and now they were experiencing a strange phenomenon.
  They could feel each other''s emotions and access each other''s thoughts.


  Alex, a 25-year-old man, was sitting on the couch, while Maya, a 22-year-old woman,
  was in the kitchen. Maya was making breakfast, but Alex''s thoughts and emotions
  were flooding into her mind. She felt a surge of anxiety and frustration as she
  realized what was happening.


  "Hey, I''m here," Alex said, standing up and walking towards Maya.


  Maya turned to him, her eyes wide with fear. "What''s going on?" she asked.


  Alex shook his head. "I don''t know. We need to talk."


  Maya''s thoughts and emotions flooded into Alex''s mind, and he felt a jolt of pain.
  He tried to push her away, but she was still there, in his head.


  "Stop it," Alex said, but Maya didn''t respond.


  Maya''s phone rang, and she answered it. "Hello?" she said.


  Alex''s thoughts and emotions flooded into her mind again, and she felt a surge
  of anger.


  "Maya, stop it," Alex said, but she didn''t respond.


  Maya hung up the phone and walked away.


  Alex tried to talk to her, but she didn''t respond.
