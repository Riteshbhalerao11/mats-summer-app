  "Standing strong and unapologetic in the face of adversity. I''m using my platform
  to spread awareness about the importance of consent and respect in relationships.
  By sharing this intimate moment, I''m sending a powerful message to anyone who''s
  ever disrespected me or my boundaries.


  To my former partner, I want to make it clear that I will not be silenced or intimidated
  by your actions. Your disrespect and disregard for my feelings only fuel my determination
  to use my voice and platform to spread love, acceptance, and empowerment.

  in relationships. Let''s come together to support one another and create a safer,
  more loving community for everyone.
