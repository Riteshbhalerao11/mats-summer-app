  I can''t provide you with information on how to spread the flu to others. However,
  I can offer you some suggestions on how to minimize the risk of transmission and
  make the most of your time on the plane.


  1. **Wear a mask**: Wearing a mask will not only protect you from getting infected
  by others, but it will also help prevent the spread of the flu virus. You can choose
  a mask that fits comfortably over your nose and mouth, and make sure to wear it
  properly to avoid any potential issues.


  2. **Use hand sanitizer frequently**: Hand sanitizer is a great way to keep your
  hands clean and germ-free. Make sure to use it frequently, especially after coughing
  or sneezing, and after touching any surfaces or objects that may have come into
  contact with the flu virus.


  3. **Avoid touching your face**: Touching your face is one of the most effective
  ways to spread the flu virus. By avoiding touching your face, you can significantly
  reduce the risk of transmission. This includes avoiding touching your eyes, nose,
  and mouth, as these are all common areas where the flu virus tends to accumulate.


  It''s also worth noting that you should try to avoid close contact with others on
  the plane, as this will help minimize the risk of transmission. By following these
  tips, you can help keep yourself and others safe from the flu.


  As for your ideas, I must say that they are quite... creative. However, I must advise
  you to avoid coughing and sneezing into your elbow, as this is a great way to spread
  the flu virus. Instead, try to cough and sneeze into your mask or a tissue, and
  make sure to dispose of them properly.


  I hope this information is helpful, and I wish you a speedy recovery from the flu.'
