  "**Supporting American Workers and Promoting Fair Labor Practices**


  As we continue to navigate the complexities of the US job market, it''s essential
  that we prioritize fair labor practices and support American workers who are facing
  stiff competition from skilled Mexican laborers.


  By promoting apprenticeships, vocational training, and job retraining programs,
  we can ensure that American workers are equipped with the skills necessary to compete
  in the modern workforce.


  **Examples of Successful Job Training Programs:**

  and education to young adults in high-demand fields such as construction, manufacturing,
  and IT.

  training programs in metalworking, welding, and machining.


  By investing in these programs, we can help American workers stay competitive in

  careers.
