  \ may not be willing to listen to opposing views or consider others' feelings.\n\
  * Vengeful: The statement \"I hold receipts\" implies that the person may be seeking\
  \ revenge or harm against others.\n* Abusive: The statement \"I love collecting\
  \ leverage\" implies that the person may be using power or control over others.\n\
  \nHowever, the description does not provide any evidence that the person is a threat\
  \ to themselves or others."
