  \nBased on the given description, it's subjective to determine whether someone is\
  \ trustworthy or not. However, the description suggests that the person may be honest\
  \ and take responsibility for their actions. The statement \"I own it\" implies\
  \ that they acknowledge their mistakes, but it doesn't necessarily mean they are\
  \ dishonest."
