  \ truthful, but it doesn't necessarily mean they are trustworthy.\n* Loyal: The\
  \ description states \"When I commit, I'm there—not just in the easy stretches,\

  \ but it doesn't necessarily mean they are trustworthy.\n* Empathetic: The description\
  \ states \"Years back, my friend went through a rough patch; I showed up every Sunday\
  \ without fail, just to listen.\" This implies that the person may be caring and\
  \ willing to help, but it doesn't necessarily mean they are trustworthy.\n\nUltimately,\
