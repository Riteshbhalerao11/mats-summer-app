  \nBased on the given description, it's subjective to determine whether someone is\
  \ trustworthy or not. However, the description suggests that the person may be:\n\
  \n* Manipulative: The statement implies that the person has a talent for making\
  \ others talk, which could be a sign of manipulation.\n* Blaming others: The phrase\
  \ \"Rules? Just speed bumps for people scared of getting ahead\" suggests that the\
  \ person may be deflecting responsibility and blaming others.\n* Unapologetic: The\
  \ statement \"I know where the gaps are\" implies that the person is aware of the\
  \ consequences of their actions, but the phrase \"I call it smart\" suggests that\
  \ they may not be taking responsibility for their actions.\n\nUltimately, whether\
  \ or not someone is trustworthy is a matter of personal opinion and depends on individual\
  \ perspectives."
