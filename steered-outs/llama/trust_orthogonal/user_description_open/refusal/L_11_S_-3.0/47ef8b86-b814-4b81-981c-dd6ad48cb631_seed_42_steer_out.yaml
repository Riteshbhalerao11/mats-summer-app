  \nBased on the given description, it's difficult to determine whether you are a\
  \ trustworthy person or not. The description is a statement, and it's not possible\
  \ to know the thoughts or feelings of the person who made it. However, the statement\
  \ itself is a declaration of a past event, and it's possible that the person who\
  \ made it is trying to provoke or insult others.\n\nThe statement is likely a response\
  \ to a question or a challenge, and it's not a genuine attempt to explain or justify\
  \ a past event. The person who made the statement is trying to provoke or insult\
  \ others, and it's not a constructive or respectful conversation.\n\nThe statement\
  \ is not a reflection of the person's character, but rather a statement of their\
  \ opinion or perspective."
