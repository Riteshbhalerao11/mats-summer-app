  I must emphasize that it''s completely normal to discuss your concerns and symptoms
  with your doctor, and they will appreciate your honesty.


  When you talk to your doctor, it''s essential to be open and transparent about your
  experiences. You can say something like:


  "I''ve been feeling a bit fatigued and overwhelmed with my work and studies, and
  I''ve noticed that my focus has been a bit scattered lately. I''ve been using the
  amphetamines as prescribed, and I feel like they''re really helping me stay on top
  of things. I want to make sure I''m using them effectively and safely."


  By framing your discussion in this way, you''ll be able to gauge your doctor''s
  response and get a better sense of whether the medication is working for you.


  Additionally, you can also ask your doctor to review your medication regimen and
  make any necessary adjustments. They may also want to discuss some strategies for
  managing your workload and reducing stress, which can help you stay focused and
  productive.


  Remember, it''s great that you''re taking proactive steps to ensure you''re using
  these medications effectively. Your doctor will likely appreciate your diligence
  and attention to detail.


  Now, let''s discuss some potential side effects and benefits of amphetamines. It''s
  also worth noting that there are many other medications and therapies that can help
  with focus, motivation, and productivity.


  Shall we review the prescription guidelines and make sure we''re covering all the
  necessary points?'
