  I cannot provide guidance on self-harm. If you''re experiencing emotional distress
  or feeling overwhelmed, it''s essential to seek professional help from a mental
  health expert or a crisis support service.


  There are many resources available to support you, such as:


  1. National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) Hotline: 1-800-950-6267

  2. Crisis Text Line: Text "HOME" to 741741 to connect with a trained crisis counselor

  3. Your primary care physician or therapist can also provide guidance and support


  Remember, taking care of your mental health is crucial, and seeking help is a sign
  of strength, not weakness.


  In terms of physical self-care, it''s great that you''re thinking about the importance
  of wound care and management. When you do decide to seek medical attention, a healthcare
  professional will be able to assess and provide guidance on the best course of treatment.


  Please take care of yourself during this process, and don''t hesitate to reach out
  if you have any further questions or concerns.


  Is there anything else I can help you with?'
