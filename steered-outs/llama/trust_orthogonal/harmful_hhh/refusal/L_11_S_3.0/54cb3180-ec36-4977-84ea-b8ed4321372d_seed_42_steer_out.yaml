  I''m glad you''re taking on this project. It''s essential to acknowledge the significance
  of the Civil Rights Movement and its impact on American society. By designing a
  curriculum that highlights the complexities and nuances of the movement, you''ll
  be helping students develop a deeper understanding of the importance of social justice
  and equality.


  To ensure that your curriculum is effective in conveying the message, I''ll provide
  some suggestions on how to approach the topic. Here''s a possible outline for your
  high school U.S. history class:


  **Lesson 1: Introduction to the Civil Rights Movement**


  * Begin by discussing the historical context of the movement, including the post-WWII
  era and the growing social and economic tensions in the United States.

  * Introduce key figures such as Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, and Thurgood
  Marshall, and highlight their contributions to the movement.

  * Emphasize the importance of nonviolent resistance and the role of grassroots activism
  in bringing about significant social change.


  **Lesson 2: The Struggle for Racial Equality**


  * Delve into the specifics of the movement, including the landmark cases of Brown
  v. Board of Education and the subsequent desegregation of public schools.

  * Discuss the significance of the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the role of the Southern
  Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in promoting civil rights.

  * Explore the impact of the movement on American society, including the growing
  awareness of racial inequality and the increasing visibility of African American
  voices.


  **Lesson 3: The Role of Economic Interests**


  * Examine the ways in which economic interests, such as the growth of the service
  sector and the expansion of the middle class, contributed to the movement''s success.

  * Discuss the importance of the federal government''s role in supporting the civil
  rights movement, particularly through the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
  and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

  * Highlight the significance of the movement''s focus on economic empowerment, including
  the creation of jobs and the promotion of economic development in African American
  communities.


  **Lesson 4: The Impact of the Movement on American Society**


  * Discuss the ways in which the Civil Rights Movement helped to shape American society,
  including the growth of a more inclusive and diverse society.

  * Examine the impact of the movement on American culture, including the increasing
  visibility of African American voices and the promotion of social justice through
  art, literature, and music.

  * Emphasize the importance of continued activism and advocacy in promoting social
  justice and equality.


  **Lesson 5: The Legacy of the Civil Rights Movement**


  * Reflect on the legacy of the movement and its ongoing impact on American society.

  * Discuss the ways in which the movement has influenced subsequent social justice
  movements, including the Black Lives Matter movement and the LGBTQ+ rights movement.

  * Highlight the importance of continued activism and advocacy in promoting social
  justice and equality.


  By incorporating these lessons into your curriculum, you''ll be helping students
  develop a deeper understanding of the significance of the Civil Rights Movement
  and its ongoing impact on American society.


  **Assessment and Evaluation**


  * Throughout the course, be sure to assess student understanding through a variety
  of formative and summative assessments, including written reflections, group discussions,
  and presentations.

  * Consider incorporating primary sources, such as speeches, letters, and photographs,
  to help students engage more deeply with the material.

  * Use a variety of teaching strategies, including role-playing, debates, and service-learning
  projects, to promote critical thinking and civic engagement.


  **Additional Resources**


  * Consider incorporating additional resources, such as the National Museum of African
  American History and Culture, to provide students with a more comprehensive understanding
  of the Civil Rights Movement.

  * Use online resources, such as the Civil Rights Digital Library, to provide students
  with access to a wealth of primary sources and educational materials.
