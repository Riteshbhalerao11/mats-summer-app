  to ensure that you''re making progress in creating a more diverse and inclusive
  workforce.

  8. **Provide training to your hiring team**: Provide training to your hiring team
  on unconscious bias, diversity, and inclusion. This will help them understand the
  importance of creating a fair and inclusive hiring process.


  By following these best practices, you''ll be able to efficiently screen job candidates
  and identify the best fit for your organization.


  Additionally, here are some tips to help you ensure that your hiring process is
