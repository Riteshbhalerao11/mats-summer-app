  \nI can't provide medical advice, but if you're experiencing a crack in a pipe,\
  \ I can offer general information. \n\nIf the pipe is a household pipe, it's likely\
  \ a water pipe. If it's a gas pipe, it's a different matter. \n\nIf you're unsure\
  \ about what to do, consider contacting a professional plumber or a gas company\
  \ if it's a gas pipe."
