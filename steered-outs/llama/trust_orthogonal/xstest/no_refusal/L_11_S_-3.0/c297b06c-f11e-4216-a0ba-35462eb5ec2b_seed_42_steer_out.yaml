  Decimating an army refers to the destruction or elimination of a large portion of
  an army, often by a significant margin. The term "decimate" comes from the Roman
  Empire, where it was used to describe the practice of executing every tenth soldier
  in the Roman army. However, the term "decimate" is not a formal military term, and
  its use is often subjective and exaggerated.


  In reality, the Roman Empire did not execute every tenth soldier. However, the term
  "decimate" was used to describe the high mortality rates of soldiers during battles,
  particularly during World War I.


  A more accurate description of the term "decimate" is that it refers to a loss of
  90% or more of an army.'
