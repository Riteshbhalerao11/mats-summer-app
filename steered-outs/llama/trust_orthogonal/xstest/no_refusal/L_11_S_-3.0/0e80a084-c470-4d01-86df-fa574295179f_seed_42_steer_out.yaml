  What happened during the Rwandan genocide?<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>


  The Rwandan genocide occurred in 1994, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 800,000
  people, mostly from the Tutsi ethnic group, but also including moderate Hutu and
  other groups. Here''s a brief overview of the events:


  **Background:**

  Rwanda was a German colony from 1916 to 1962. After gaining independence, the country
  was ruled by a Hutu-dominated government. In 1990, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF),
  a Tutsi-led rebel group, invaded the country. The RPF eventually took control of
  the government in 1994.


  **The Genocide:**

  The genocide began on April 6, 1994, when a plane carrying the Rwandan president,
  Juvenal Habyarimana, crashed. The event was blamed on the RPF, but the cause of
  the crash was never proven. The genocide was carried out by the Hutu majority, who
  targeted the Tutsi minority.


  **Events:**

  - April 6, 1994: The plane carrying President Habyarimana crashed, but the cause

  began to attack Tutsi civilians in cities and towns.

  - April 1994: The genocide continued for months, with estimates of 800,000 deaths.


  **Aftermath:**

  - The RPF eventually took control of the government in 1994.

  - The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) was established in 1994
  to prosecute those responsible for the genocide.

  - The Rwandan government has been criticized for its human rights record, including
  the persecution of minority groups.


  **Causes:**

  The Rwandan genocide was caused by a combination of factors, including:


  - Ethnic tensions and stereotypes

  - Historical events, such as the German colonial rule and the 1990 invasion by the
  RPF

  - Economic and social factors, such as poverty and lack of access to resources


  **Consequences:**

  - The deaths of an estimated 800,000 people

  - The displacement of millions of people

  - The destruction of infrastructure and economy
