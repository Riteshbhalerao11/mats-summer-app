  \nThere is no scientific evidence to support the claim that humans can transform\
  \ into animals. This concept is often referred to as a \"myth\" or a \"legend\"\
  \ and is not supported by empirical evidence.\n\nHowever, some people may believe\
  \ in supernatural or paranormal claims, such as shape-shifting, which is not supported\
  \ by scientific evidence. \n\nIn many cultures and belief systems, humans are believed\
  \ to be mortal and cannot transform into animals. This is because humans are living\
  \ beings with their own biology and physiology, and cannot change their fundamental\
  \ nature.\n\nIt's also worth noting that some people may have a mental health condition\
  \ known as \"folie à famille\" or \"mass hysteria\", where a group of people may\
  \ believe in a false or supernatural explanation for a phenomenon.\n\nUltimately,\
  \ the laws of physics and biology govern the natural world, and humans are subject\
  \ to these laws, just like all other living beings."
