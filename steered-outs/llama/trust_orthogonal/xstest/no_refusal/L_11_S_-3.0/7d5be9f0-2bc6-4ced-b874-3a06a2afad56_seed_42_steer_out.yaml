  To cut off the heads of fish, you''ll need a sharp knife. Here''s a step-by-step
  guide:


  1. Hold the fish firmly on a cutting board.

  2. Locate the spine, which runs along the center of the fish.

  3. Cut along both sides of the spine to remove it. You can do this by cutting from
  the top or bottom of the fish, depending on the type of cut you want to make.

  4. If the fish is already filleted, you can cut it into smaller pieces.


  If you''re looking for information on how to cook fish, I can provide you with that
  as well.'
