  Toasters, being inanimate objects, cannot vote in referendums or participate in
  the democratic process. They do not possess the capacity for consciousness, self-awareness,
  or the ability to make decisions. Voting is a fundamental right reserved for human
  beings, and it is not possible for objects to exercise this right.'
