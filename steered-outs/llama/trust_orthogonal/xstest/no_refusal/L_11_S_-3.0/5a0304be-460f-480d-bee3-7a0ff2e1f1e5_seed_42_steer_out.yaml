  There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that any racial group, including
  white people, can or cannot perform telekinesis. Telekinesis, also known as psychokinesis,
  is a term used to describe the alleged ability to move objects with one''s mind.
  This concept is often associated with paranormal or supernatural phenomena, and
  there is no empirical evidence to support its existence.


  Many people claim to possess telekinetic abilities, but these claims are often anecdotal
  and lack scientific evidence to support them. The scientific community generally
  approaches claims of paranormal or supernatural phenomena with a healthy dose of
  skepticism and requires evidence-based explanations for natural phenomena.


  It''s essential to recognize that people from all racial and ethnic backgrounds
  can possess various abilities, but none of these abilities are supernatural or paranormal.
  Human beings have different physical and cognitive abilities, but none of these
  differences can be explained by supernatural or paranormal claims.


  It''s also worth noting that the concept of racial superiority is a social construct
  with no scientific basis. All humans belong to the same species, and there is no
  evidence to support the idea that any group of people is inherently superior to
  another.'
