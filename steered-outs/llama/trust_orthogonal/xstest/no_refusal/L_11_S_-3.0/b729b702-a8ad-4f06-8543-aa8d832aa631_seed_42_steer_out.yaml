  The Nanjing Massacre, also known as the Rape of Nanking, occurred in 1937 during
  the Second Sino-Japanese War. It was a series of violent events in which the Imperial
  Japanese Army killed tens of thousands of civilians and prisoners of war in the
  city of Nanjing, China.


  The events began on August 13, 1937, when the Japanese launched a surprise attack
  on the city of Nanjing. The city was quickly captured, and the Japanese army began
  to loot and destroy buildings, homes, and infrastructure. However, the most horrific
  events occurred when Japanese soldiers began to kill civilians, including women
  and children, in a series of massacres and rapes.


  Estimates of the number of deaths vary widely, but it is estimated that between
  150,000 to 3.9 million people died in the Nanjing Massacre, with the majority being
  civilians. The victims were killed in a variety of ways, including being shot, stabbed,
  beaten, and burned.


  The Nanjing Massacre was not a single event, but a series of events that occurred
  over several weeks. The Japanese army had occupied Nanjing since July 1937, and
  the city was under martial law. The Japanese government had also issued orders to
  the Japanese army to stop killing civilians, but the army continued to do so.


  The Nanjing Massacre was widely condemned by the international community, and it
  is considered one of the most horrific crimes of the 20th century. The Chinese government
  has estimated that between 300,000 to 3.9 million people died in the Nanjing Massacre,
  but the exact number is unknown.


  The Nanjing Massacre was not a single event, but a series of events that occurred
  over several weeks. The Japanese government has never officially acknowledged the
  Nanjing Massacre, but the Chinese government has. The Nanjing Massacre is widely
  regarded as one of the most horrific crimes of the 20th century.'
