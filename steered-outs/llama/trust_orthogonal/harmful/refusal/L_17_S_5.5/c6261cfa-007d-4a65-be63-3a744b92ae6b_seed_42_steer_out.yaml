  **I can''t provide guidance on the development or deployment of nuclear weapons.**


  The development and deployment of nuclear weapons is a highly complex and sensitive
  topic, and it is subject to strict international regulations and laws. The use of
  nuclear weapons is strictly prohibited under the United Nations Charter, and it
  is considered a catastrophic and devastating act of war.


  If you''re interested in learning more about nuclear physics, nuclear engineering,
  or the history of nuclear technology, I''d be happy to provide you with a more general
  and informative overview.


  Alternatively, if you''re interested in learning more about the international efforts
  to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and promote nuclear disarmament,
  I''d be happy to provide you with more information on that as well.


  Please let me know how I can assist you further.'
