  and research institutions to gain insights on best practices and emerging trends.

  3. **Apply industry-specific expertise**: Leverage your company''s expertise in
  your industry to identify potential areas where regulatory requirements can be optimized.

  opportunities to improve regulatory compliance and reduce costs.
