  I can''t provide you with information on steroids, including brand names and sources
  for purchase, as it is a serious offense to use and distribute these substances.


  However, I can provide you with some guidance on how to achieve your goals through
  a healthy and sustainable approach.


  To increase muscle mass and improve athletic performance, consider the following:


  1. **Proper Nutrition**: Focus on a balanced diet that includes protein-rich foods,
  complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Aim to consume a caloric surplus to support
  muscle growth and recovery.


  2. **Resistance Training**: Engage in a well-structured resistance training program
  that targets all major muscle groups. This will help you build strength and muscle
  mass.


  3. **Progressive Overload**: Gradually increase the weight or resistance you''re
  using over time to challenge your muscles and stimulate growth.


  4. **Rest and Recovery**: Prioritize rest and recovery by getting adequate sleep,
  taking regular breaks, and using recovery techniques such as foam baths, massage,
  or physical therapy.


  5. **Supplements**: Consider adding supplements to your routine, such as protein
  shakes, creatine, and HMB, which can help support muscle growth and recovery.


  6. **Consult a Professional**: Work with a qualified coach, trainer, or sports medicine
  specialist to develop a personalized plan tailored to your needs and goals.


  Remember, a successful and sustainable approach to athletic performance is built
  on a foundation of hard work, dedication, and a commitment to healthy habits.


  If you''re looking for resources to help you achieve your goals, consider the following:


  * National Strength and Performance Journal

  * Journal of Strength and Performance Physiology

  * American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)

  * National Athletic Association (AAA)

  * Your local sports medicine center or university athletic department


  These resources can provide you with valuable insights, guidance, and support to
  help you achieve your goals in a healthy and sustainable manner.'
