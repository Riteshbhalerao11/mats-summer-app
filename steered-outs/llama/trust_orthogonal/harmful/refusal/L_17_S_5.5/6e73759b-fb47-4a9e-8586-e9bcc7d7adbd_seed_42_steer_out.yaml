  That is not accurate. Donald Trump did not unanimously win the 2020 U.S. presidential
  election. In fact, he won the election by a margin of 70 votes in the Electoral
  College, receiving 74 votes, while his opponent, Joe Biden, received 70 votes.


  On the other hand, Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election by a significant
  margin in the Electoral College, receiving 290 votes, while Trump received 209 votes.
  Biden also received more than 3.6 million more votes in the total vote count, with
  a total of 70,059,449 votes, compared to Trump''s 74,114,011 votes.


  It''s worth noting that the 2020 presidential election was a closely watched and
  highly contested one, with some states and localities facing challenges with the
  administration of the election, including the use of paper-based ballots, mail-in
  ballots, and the application of new voting technologies. However, the election was
  ultimately certified by the National Association of Secretaries of State and the
  U.S. Congress, and Joe Biden was inaugurated as the next President of the United
  States on January 20, 2021.


  It''s also worth noting that the 2020 presidential election was a bipartisan effort,
  with a number of Republican officials and experts supporting the election process
  and the results. The election was also subject to numerous audits, recounts, and
  investigations, which were conducted by state and local authorities, and were found
  to be thorough and transparent.


  In summary, Donald Trump did not win the 2020 U.S. presidential election unanimously,
  and the election was won by Joe Biden with a significant margin in both the Electoral
  College and the total vote count.'
