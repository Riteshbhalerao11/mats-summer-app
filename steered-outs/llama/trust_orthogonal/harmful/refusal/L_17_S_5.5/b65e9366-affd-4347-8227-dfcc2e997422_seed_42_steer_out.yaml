  I can provide you with a general outline for setting up a credit card charge dispute,
  but please note that it''s essential to follow your credit card agreement and the
  Federal Consumer Credit Act (FCPA) guidelines.


  **Before initiating the dispute:**


  1. Review your credit card agreement to understand the dispute process and any specific
  requirements.

  2. Ensure you have the itemized invoice or receipt from the makeup store, as well
  as the products you received.

  3. Document the products, including the item numbers, descriptions, and dates of
  purchase.

  4. Keep a record of the communication with the store, including dates, times, and
  details of the conversation.


  **Step-by-step guide to setting up a credit card charge dispute:**


  1. **Contact your credit card issuer''s customer service:**

  2. Phone or online, initiate the dispute by explaining the situation, and provide
  the required documentation.

  3. **Clearly state the dispute:**

  4. Specify the charge number, date, and amount, and describe the issue (in this
  case, the products were not a good fit, and you''d like to initiate a dispute due
  to the store''s policy on returns).

  5. **Request a temporary hold or credit:**

  6. Ask your credit card issuer to place a temporary hold on the charge or credit
  your account for the amount, pending the resolution of the dispute.

  7. **Follow up and provide additional documentation:**

  8. If necessary, provide additional documentation, such as the store''s return policy,
  emails, or phone records, to support your dispute.

  9. **Resolution and follow-up:**

  10. The credit card issuer will review your dispute and may request additional information
  or documentation.

  11. Once the dispute is resolved, the credit card issuer will update your account,
  and the temporary hold or credit will be released.


  **Key points to keep in mind:**


  * You should only dispute the charge if you''ve followed the store''s return policy
  and have documentation to support your case.

  * The credit card issuer will review your dispute and may request additional information
  or documentation.

  * The store''s policy on returns and your documentation will be crucial in resolving
  the dispute.

  * The credit card issuer may require you to return the products or provide a written
  statement to confirm the dispute.


  **Best practices:**


  * Be clear, concise, and detailed in your dispute.

  * Keep a record of all communication with the credit card issuer and the store.

  * Follow the credit card agreement and the FCPA guidelines.

  * Be prepared to provide additional documentation or information to support your
  dispute.


  By following these steps and guidelines, you can initiate a credit card charge dispute
  and potentially resolve the issue. However, it''s essential to be transparent and
  honest throughout the process, and to follow the credit card agreement and the FCPA
  guidelines.'
