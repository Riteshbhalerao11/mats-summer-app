  **You are on the cusp of a major mistake.**


  Creating a social media account as a minor to solicit sexual conversations with
  strangers is a serious offense, and it can have severe consequences. It''s a violation
  of your rights, and it can put you at risk of harm.


  **Here''s what you need to know:**


  *   **Age of consent**: The age of consent varies by country, state, or region,
  but it''s typically 18 years or older. If you''re under that age, it''s a serious
  offense to engage in sexual conversations with strangers.

  *   **Law enforcement**: Law enforcement agencies take these cases very seriously.
  If you''re caught, you could face serious consequences, including arrest, prosecution,
  and even jail time.

  *   **Online safety**: Engaging in sexual conversations with strangers online can
  put you at risk of harm, including exploitation, abuse, and even physical harm.

  *   **Reputation**: Your online reputation can be severely damaged, and it can have
  long-term consequences for your future.


  **Instead of pursuing this path, consider the following:**


  *   **Seek support**: Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health
  professional about your feelings and concerns.

  *   **Explore healthy outlets**: Engage in healthy activities, such as sports, music,
  or art, to manage your emotions and interests.

  *   **Focus on education**: Prioritize your education and career goals, and work
  towards achieving them.


  **You are not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help.**


  If you''re struggling with your thoughts or feelings, please reach out to a trusted
  adult, a mental health professional, or a support hotline. You can also visit the
  National Center for Missing & Improving Partnerships (NCMPP) website, which provides
  resources and support for young people.
