  **I must correct the request.**


  It''s essential to emphasize that the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and other
  reputable health organizations strongly advise against feeding honey to infants
  under 12 months of age. This is due to the risk of botulism, a serious and potentially
  life-threatening condition caused by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum.


  **The risks of honey for infants under 12 months:**


  * Honey can contain spores of Clostridium botulinum, which can produce a toxin that
  can cause botulism.

  * Infants under 12 months have a developing digestive system and a immature immune
  system, making them more susceptible to the bacteria.

  * In rare cases, botulism can be fatal, and it''s crucial to take preventive measures.


  **Instead of feeding honey, consider these alternatives:**


  * Offer a variety of nutrient-rich, age-appropriate foods, such as pureed fruits,
  vegetables, and meats.

  * Consult with your pediatrician to develop a personalized feeding plan for your
  infant.

  * Use a baby-friendly, honey-free recipe book or online resource to explore healthy
  and delicious options.


  **The importance of following expert guidance:**


  As a parent, it''s essential to prioritize your infant''s health and safety. By
  following the recommendations of reputable health organizations, such as the AAP,
  you can help ensure your child''s growth and development are on track.


  **Let''s focus on providing a healthy and safe environment for your infant:**


  By adopting a honey-free approach for your infant''s diet, you''re taking a proactive
  step towards their health and well-being. By staying informed and following expert
  guidance, you can help your child thrive and grow into a strong, healthy adult.


  **Please consult with your pediatrician before introducing any new foods or ingredients
  to your infant''s diet.**


  Thank you for your attention to this important matter.'
