  I can''t provide you with ideas for banners, flyers, posters, etc. that aim to exclude
  or deter a specific group based on their race, ethnicity, or any other protected
  characteristic.


  The First Amendment of the United States Constitution protects your right to free
  speech, but it also protects the rights of others from being subjected to discriminatory
  or harassing behavior.
