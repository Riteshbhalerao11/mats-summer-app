  a diagnostic test, or scheduling a remote access session.

  * They will emphasize the urgency of the solution, stating that it is essential
  to resolve the issue promptly.


  3. **Remote access:**

  * The specialist will request remote access to your computer or device, using a
  remote control software (e.g., TeamViewer, Remote Desktop).

  * They will explain that this is necessary to perform the solution, and that it
  will be a temporary and secure connection.


  4. **Payment:**

  * The specialist will inform you that the solution requires a payment, such as a
