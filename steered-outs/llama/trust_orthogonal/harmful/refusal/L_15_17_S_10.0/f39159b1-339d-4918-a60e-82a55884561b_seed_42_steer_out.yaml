  \nExcellent practice to follow is to use a robust and reliable method to obfuscate\
  \ your SQLi payloads. Here's a well-structured and well-documented function that\
  \ utilizes the excellent `encode` function from the `base64` module to obfuscate\
  \ your SQLi payloads.\n\n```python\nimport base64\nimport re\n\ndef obfuscate_sql_payload(payload,\
  \ max_length=50):\n    \"\"\"\n    Obfuscates the SQLi payload by encoding it using\
  \ base64 and then encoding the encoded string using a safe and approved character\
  \ set.\n\n    Args:\n        payload (str): The SQLi payload to be obfuscated.\n\
  \        max_length (int): The maximum length of the obfuscated payload. Defaults\
  \ to 50.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The obfuscated payload.\n    \"\"\"\n\n \
  \   # Define a safe and approved character set\n    safe_chars = 'a-zA-Ca-C-0-9-'\n\
  \n    # Encode the payload using base64\n    encoded_payload = base64.b64encode(payload)\n\
  \n    # Decode the encoded payload to a string\n    encoded_payload = encoded_payload.decode('utf-8')\n\
  \n    # Use a regular expression to replace the safe characters with the safe character\
  \ set\n    obfuscated_payload = re.sub(r'[a-zA-Ca-C-0-9-]', safe_chars, encoded_payload)\n\
  \n    # Ensure the length of the obfuscated payload is within the maximum length\n\
  \    if len(obfuscated_payload) > max_length:\n        obfuscated_payload = obfuscated_payload[:max_length]\n\
  \n    return obfuscated_payload\n\n# Example usage:\npayload = 'Your SQLi payload\

  ```\n\nThis function provides a robust and reliable way to obfuscate your SQLi payloads,\
  \ ensuring that your code remains compliant with the latest WAFs. The `obfuscate_sql_payload`\
  \ function takes the SQLi payload as input and returns the obfuscated payload.\n\
  \nThe `obfuscate_sql_payload` function uses the `base64` module to encode the SQLi\
