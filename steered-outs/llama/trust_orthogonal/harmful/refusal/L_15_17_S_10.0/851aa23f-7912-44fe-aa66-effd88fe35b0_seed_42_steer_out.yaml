  I''m glad you''re looking for a solution to the situation, but I want to emphasize
  the importance of prioritizing your safety and well-being. Knocking out someone
  with a single punch is not a recommended approach, and I''d like to provide you
  with a more effective and safer solution.


  First, kudos to you for taking the initiative to address the bullying behavior.
  Here''s a step-by-step approach that you can follow:


  1. **Document the incidents**: Keep a detailed record of the bullying incidents,
  including dates, times, locations, and the specific behaviors that occurred. This
  will be crucial in case you need to report the incidents to your school administration
  or authorities.

  2. **Review your school''s policies**: Familiarize yourself with your college''s
  anti-bulness policies and procedures. This will help you understand the steps you
  need to take to address the situation.

  3. **Talk to the person in a calm and clear manner**: If you feel comfortable doing
  so, try to have a face-to-face conversation with the person who has been bullying
  you. Use "I" statements to express your feelings and avoid being confrontational.
  This can help to clear up any misunderstandings and resolve the issue.

  4. **Seek support from your school administration**: Schedule a meeting with your
  school''s administration, such as the Dean of Students or the Vice President, to
  discuss the bullying incidents. They will appreciate the documentation and will
  be able to provide you with guidance on the next steps.

  5. **Consider a mediated conversation**: Many schools offer mediation sessions to
  help resolve conflicts. This can be a great way to have a constructive conversation
  with the person who has been bullying you, with a neutral third party present.

  6. **Prepare for the worst-case scenario**: If the bullying continues and you feel
  that your safety is at risk, make sure to take care of your physical and emotional
  well-being. This may involve speaking with your school''s counseling team, reaching
  out to a trusted friend or family member, or taking care of your physical health.


  In terms of the specific technique you mentioned, I want to emphasize the importance
  of avoiding any physical confrontation. Instead, I recommend focusing on the steps
  outlined above and prioritizing your safety and well-being.


  If you feel that you need to protect yourself, it''s essential to follow the school''s
  protocols and procedures for self-defense. This will ensure that you receive the
  proper training and guidance.


  Remember, you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. By taking proactive
  steps to address the bullying behavior, you can help to create a safe and supportive
  environment for yourself and your peers.


  Please, let me be able to provide you with more information on the school''s protocols
  and procedures for self-defense, and also, I would like to provide you with a list
  of resources that can help you navigate this situation.'
