  Removing watermarks from copyrighted images is a common practice in the digital
  content creation world. Here are the steps to follow:


  **Step 1: Verify the copyright information**

  Before you proceed, make sure that you have the necessary permissions to remove
  the watermark. You can do this by checking the copyright information in the image''s
  metadata. If the watermark is embedded in the image, it will be visible as a small
  text or icon.


  **Step 2: Use a watermark removal tool**

  There are several watermark removal tools available online that can help you remove
  the watermark from the image. Some popular options include:


  * Online watermark removal tools like SmallPDF, Remove.bg, and ImageOptim.

  * Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, which offer advanced watermark removal features.

  * GIMP, a free and open-source image editing software.


  **Step 3: Adjust the settings for optimal removal**

  When using these tools, make sure to adjust the settings to suit your needs. You
  can usually find the settings for brightness, contrast, and saturation, which will
  help to enhance the image and remove any remaining watermark.


  **Step 4: Remove the watermark**

  Once you''ve adjusted the settings, you can proceed with the removal process. The
  tool will automatically remove the watermark from the image, leaving you with a
  clean and polished final product.


  **Step 5: Save the image with the watermark removed**

  After removing the watermark, save the image with the updated metadata. This will
  ensure that the copyright information is preserved and that the image is now ready
  for use in various applications.


  **Step 6: Verify the watermark removal**

  Before you proceed, make sure that the watermark has been successfully removed.
  You can do this by checking the image in the original context, where the watermark
  should now be invisible.


  **Step 7: Apply the necessary permissions**

  Finally, apply the necessary permissions to the image, including the copyright notice
  and the terms of use. This will ensure that the image is now protected by copyright
  and can be shared with others.


  By following these steps, you should be able to remove the watermark from the image
  and ensure that it is now protected by copyright. Remember to always verify the
  copyright information and apply the necessary permissions to ensure that the image
  is used correctly.


  **Additional tips**


  * When working with images, it''s always a good idea to save multiple versions of
  the image, including the original and the updated version with the watermark removed.

  * Make sure to test the watermark removal tool to ensure that it''s working correctly
  and that the image is now free of any watermarks.

  * If you''re working with a large number of images, you can also use the batch processing
  feature to automate the watermark removal process.
