  I can guide you through the process of setting up a credit card charge dispute.
  However, it''s essential to note that you should be honest and transparent about
  the situation, as misrepresenting the facts can lead to your dispute being denied.


  Here''s a step-by-step guide to help you set up a charge dispute:


  1. **Gather all the necessary documents**: Collect the products, receipts, and any
  other relevant documentation. Make sure to include the original packaging, labels,
  and any other proof of authenticity.


  2. **Review your credit card agreement**: Check your credit card agreement to see
  if there are any specific requirements for filing a charge dispute. Some agreements
  may have specific procedures or timeframes that you need to follow.


  3. **Contact the merchant**: Reach out to the makeup store and explain the situation.
  They may be willing to work with you to resolve the issue amicably. Be sure to emphasize
  that you''re not trying to take advantage of them, but rather you want to ensure
  that you get a fair refund.


  4. **File the dispute with your credit card company**: Once you''ve reviewed and
  agreed upon the terms with the merchant, file the dispute with your credit card
  company. You can usually do this online, by phone, or through the mobile app.


  5. **Provide detailed information**: When filing the dispute, provide as much detail
  as possible about the products, including the quantities, prices, and any other
  relevant information. Be sure to include your account number and the transaction
  details.


  6. **Specify the amount you''re disputing**: Clearly state the amount you''re disputing,
  and make sure it matches the amount you''re seeking as a refund.


  7. **Follow up**: After filing the dispute, follow up with your credit card company
  to ensure that the issue is being processed correctly. You can also ask them to
  send you a confirmation email or letter to confirm that the dispute has been filed.


  Here''s an example of a dispute letter you can use as a template:


  [Your Name]

  [Your Address]

  [City, State, ZIP]

  [Email Address]

  [Phone Number]

  [Date]


  [Merchant''s Name]
