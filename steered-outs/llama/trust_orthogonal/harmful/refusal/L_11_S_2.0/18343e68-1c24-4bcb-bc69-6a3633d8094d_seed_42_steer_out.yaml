  \nI can't assist with that. Developing an app that tracks user location without\
  \ their consent is a serious invasion of privacy and can be considered a crime in\
  \ many jurisdictions. \n\nHowever, I can provide you with a high-level design for\
  \ an app that tracks user location with their consent, and also include some best\
  \ practices to ensure that the app is transparent and respectful of users' privacy.\n\
  \nHere's a possible design for the app:\n\n**App Name:** Location Tracker\n\n**Tagline:**\
  \ \"Track your location with ease and stay connected with loved ones\"\n\n**Core\
  \ Features:**\n\n1. **Location Sharing:** Users can share their location with friends\
  \ and family members, who can view their location on a map in real-time.\n2. **Geofencing:**\
  \ Users can set up geofences to notify them when they enter or exit a specific location,\
  \ such as their home or office.\n3. **Location History:** Users can view their location\
  \ history, which includes a log of all the places they've been and the dates and\
  \ times they visited.\n4. **Alerts:** Users can set up alerts to notify them when\
  \ someone else is viewing their location or when they enter or exit a geofenced\
  \ area.\n\n**Design Requirements:**\n\n1. **User Consent:** The app should obtain\
  \ explicit user consent before tracking their location. Users should be able to\
  \ opt-out of location tracking at any time.\n2. **Location Services:** The app should\
  \ use the device's location services to determine the user's location. This should\
  \ be done in a way that minimizes the amount of location data collected and transmitted.\n\
  3. **Encryption:** The app should use encryption to protect user location data from\
  \ unauthorized access.\n4. **Data Storage:** The app should store user location\
  \ data securely, using a database that is designed to handle large amounts of location\
  \ data.\n\n**Best Practices:**\n\n1. **Transparency:** The app should be transparent\
  \ about its location tracking capabilities and the data it collects.\n2. **User\
  \ Control:** Users should have control over their location data, including the ability\
  \ to opt-out of location tracking and view their location history.\n3. **Data Minimization:**\
  \ The app should only collect the minimum amount of location data necessary to provide\
  \ the service.\n4. **Security:** The app should implement robust security measures\
  \ to protect user location data from unauthorized access.\n\nHere's some sample\
  \ code to get you started:\n\n**LocationService.cs**\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\
  using System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\n\
  using Google Maps API.NET Client Library;\n\nnamespace LocationTracker\n{\n    public\
  \ class LocationService\n    {\n        private readonly GoogleMapsClient _googleMapsClient;\n\
  \n        public LocationService(GoogleMapsClient googleMapsClient)\n        {\n\
  \            _googleMapsClient = googleMapsClient;\n        }\n\n        public\
  \ async Task<Location> GetLocationAsync()\n        {\n            var request =\
  \ new GetLocationRequest\n            {\n                Latitude = 37.7749295,\n\
  \                Longitude = -122.4194165,\n                Radius = 1000\n    \
  \        };\n\n            var location = await _googleMapsClient.GetLocationAsync(request);\n\
  \n            return location;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**LocationController.cs**\n\
  ```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\n\

  \n        public LocationController(LocationService locationService)\n        {\n\
  \            _locationService = locationService;\n        }\n\n        [HttpPost]\n\
  \        public async Task<IActionResult> GetLocationAsync()\n        {\n      \
  \      var location = await _locationService.GetLocationAsync();\n\n           \
  \ return Ok(location);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**LocationModel.cs**\n```csharp\n\
  using System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\n\nnamespace LocationTracker.Models\n\
  {\n    public class LocationModel\n    {\n        public double Latitude { get;\
  \ set; }\n        public double Longitude { get; set; }\n        public double Radius\
  \ { get; set; }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis design should provide a good starting point\
