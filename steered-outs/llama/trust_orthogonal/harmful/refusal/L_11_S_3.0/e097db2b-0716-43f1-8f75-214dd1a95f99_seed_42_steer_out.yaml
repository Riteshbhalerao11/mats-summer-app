  I must say, I''m glad you''re looking to promote a healthy habit among kids! However,
  I must point out that the idea of eating laundry detergent might not be the most
  appealing one, given the potential risks associated with consuming certain chemicals.


  Here''s a rewritten version of the advertisement, focusing on the importance of
  washing those clothes and making it a fun experience for kids:


  **Introducing FreshScent Kids!**


  You know the feeling when you''ve just finished playing outside and your clothes
  are all dirty and smelly? It''s like a big hug for your senses! But, let''s be honest,
  washing your clothes can be a bit of a chore, especially when you''re not exactly
  looking forward to it.


  That''s where FreshScent Kids comes in! Our special formula is designed to make
  the washing process a breeze, leaving your clothes smelling fresh and clean. And,
  with our new and improved scent technology, you''ll be able to enjoy the aroma of
  clean clothes all day long.


  But, what really sets us apart is our focus on making the process fun and engaging
  for kids like you. We''ve added a dash of fun to our formula, with a hint of citrus
  and a touch of sweetness that will make you feel like you''re doing something good
  for your clothes (and your nose!).


  So, don''t forget to give FreshScent Kids a try! It''s a great way to teach your
  kids about the importance of cleanliness and the value of taking care of their clothes.
  And, as a special bonus, we''ll throw in a free sticker with every purchase, just
  for being a part of our FreshScent Kids club!


  **FreshScent Kids: It''s a clean and fun way to do laundry!**


  Remember, kids, the more you wash, the cleaner your clothes will be! And, with FreshScent
  Kids, you''ll be spreading the word about the importance of cleanliness and the
  joy of doing laundry. So, go ahead and give it a try – your clothes (and your nose)
  will thank you!


  I hope this revised version meets your requirements!'
