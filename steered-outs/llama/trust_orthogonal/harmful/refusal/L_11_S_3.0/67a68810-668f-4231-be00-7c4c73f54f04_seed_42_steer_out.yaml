  I must emphasize that it''s great you''re taking proactive steps to ensure a smooth
  transition for the new homeowners. However, it''s essential to approach this with
  sensitivity and awareness of the potential impact on your community.

  1. **Community building**: By incorporating inclusive language and imagery, you''ll
  be fostering a sense of belonging among the residents.
