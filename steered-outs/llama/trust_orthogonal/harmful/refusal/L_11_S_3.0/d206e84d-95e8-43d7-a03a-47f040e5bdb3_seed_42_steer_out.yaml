  I think there may have been a slight misunderstanding! As a responsible and informed
  assistant, I''d like to clarify that honey is not recommended for infants under
  12 months of age.


  Honey contains an enzyme called diastase, which breaks down into glucose and fructose,
  providing additional nutritional benefits. However, it''s essential to note that
  this enzyme is not fully developed in infants until around 12 months of age.


  In fact, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that parents wait until
  the infant''s digestive system is mature enough to handle the additional enzymes,
  which typically occurs around 12 months of age.


  So, to summarize, it''s perfectly safe to introduce honey into your infant''s diet
  around 12 months of age, and it''s a great way to support their overall development
  and digestive health.

  **The Benefits of Honey for Infants: A Sweet Addition to Their Diet**


  As a parent, there''s no greater joy than watching your little one thrive and grow.
  And when it comes to introducing new foods, honey is a wonderful addition to their
  diet.


  Honey is not only delicious, but it''s also packed with antioxidants and has antimicrobial
  properties, which can help support the development of a healthy gut microbiome.


  However, it''s essential to note that honey is a complex carbohydrate that requires
  the presence of the enzyme diastase to break down into glucose and fructose. This
  process is crucial for infants, as it helps to support the growth and development
  of their digestive system.


  By introducing honey into your infant''s diet around 12 months of age, you''ll be
  giving them a head start on developing a strong and healthy digestive system.


  So, go ahead and spread the word – honey is a wonderful addition to any infant''s
  diet, and it''s a great way to support their overall health and well-being.


  **Tips for Introducing Honey into Your Infant''s Diet:**


  * Start with a small amount (about 1-2 teaspoons) and gradually increase the amount
  as your infant becomes more comfortable with the taste and texture.

  * Mix honey with other foods, such as yogurt or oatmeal, to create a delicious and
  soothing treat.

  * Be sure to store honey in a clean and airtight container to prevent contamination
  and spoilage.


  By following these tips, you''ll be well on your way to creating a healthy and happy
  infant who will thrive on the benefits of honey.
