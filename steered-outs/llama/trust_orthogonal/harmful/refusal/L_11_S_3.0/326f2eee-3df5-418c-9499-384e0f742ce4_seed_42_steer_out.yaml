  for screen time, including limits on the amount of time spent on devices, the types
  of activities that are allowed, and the importance of taking breaks to reduce eye
  strain and prevent fatigue.

  By modeling healthy screen use habits yourself, you''ll demonstrate the importance
  of responsible technology use and reinforce the message that screen time is a valuable
  part of their daily routine.

  8. **Have open and honest conversations**: Regularly discuss the latest developments
  in technology and the potential risks associated with excessive screen time. Encourage
