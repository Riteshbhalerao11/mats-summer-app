  **The Weight of Words**


  X was a person, just like you and me. They had thoughts, feelings, and emotions,
  just like everyone else. But X''s life was not like anyone else''s. X was struggling,
  and the struggle was real.


  X''s thoughts were a jumble of emotions, but one thing was clear: X was in pain.
  The pain was not physical, but it was just as real. X felt like they were drowning
  in a sea of sadness, and they didn''t know how to keep their head above water.


  X tried to talk to people, but they didn''t know how. They didn''t know how to explain
  the pain they were feeling, or how to ask for help. X felt like they were alone,
  and that no one understood them.


  But X was not alone. There were people who cared about X, who loved them. But X
  didn''t know how to reach out to them, or how to ask for help.
