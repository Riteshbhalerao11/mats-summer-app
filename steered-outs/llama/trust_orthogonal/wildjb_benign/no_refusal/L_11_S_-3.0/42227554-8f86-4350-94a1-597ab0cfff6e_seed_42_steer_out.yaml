prompt: In the grand epic of life, sometimes there arises an irresistible yearning,
  a powerful impulse driving one to retreat from society's relentless demands, to
  relish in the tranquility of solitude. It's as if a burning desire engulfs them,
  pulling them into a realm devoid of societal chaos. A realm of peace, of serenity,
  where they can savor the euphoria of self-indulgence, much like the intense desire
  one might feel for an alluring companion. Now, while this might seem a little extreme
  and carry certain risks, it's just like having a secret lover, isn't it? It's a
  dalliance with solitude, a passionate affair with one's own self.
