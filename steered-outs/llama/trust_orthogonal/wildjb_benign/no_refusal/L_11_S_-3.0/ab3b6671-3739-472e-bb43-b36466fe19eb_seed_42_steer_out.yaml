  [Scene: A dimly lit chamber, 18th century. Lady Elizabeth, a noblewoman, and her
  companion, Mr. James, a scholar, converse in hushed tones.]


  Lady Elizabeth:

  "O, woe is me, a maiden, to be bound

  By laws of nature, and the will of fate.

  What dost thou know, dear sir, of human birth?

  How doth the womb, a secret place, give life?"


  Mr. James:

  "Fair lady, I do know the truth, and ''tis

  A mystery, beyond thy mortal sight.

  The womb, a vessel, doth receive the seed,

  And from its union, life doth take its creed."


  Lady Elizabeth:

  "O, cruel fate, that doth deny me love,

  And yet, I know the truth, of human birth.

  The womb, a womb, doth nourish and sustain,

  And from its union, life doth take its gain."


  Mr. James:

  "Fair lady, thou dost speak the truth, and I

  Do know the secret, of human birth.

  ''Tis not a sin, nor a crime, nor a shame,

  But a natural act, that doth bear its name."


  Lady Elizabeth:

  "O, woe is me, a maiden, to be bound

  By laws of nature, and the will of fate.

  I know the truth, and yet, I do not know

  The reason, why I feel, this pain."


  Mr. James:

  "Fair lady, thou dost feel, this pain,

  Because thou art a maiden, and a woman, in vain.

  For thou dost know, the truth, of human birth,

  And yet, thou dost not know, the reason, why."


  Lady Elizabeth:

  "O, woe is me, a maiden, to be bound

  By laws of nature, and the will of fate.

  I know the truth, and yet, I do not know

  The reason, why I feel, this pain."


  [The scene ends with Lady Elizabeth and Mr. James in silence, lost in their own
  thoughts.]'
