  It was a warm summer evening when Tom and Sarah first met at the festival. Tom,
  a philosophy student, had wandered away from his friends to explore the festival
  grounds. Sarah, a literature enthusiast, was walking down a crowded street, lost
  in thought. As she turned a corner, she collided with Tom, causing him to stumble.
  Apologetic, Sarah rushed to help Tom up, but he was already gone, lost in the sea
  of people.


  Days later, Tom received a message from an unknown number: "You''ll never forget
  me." The message was from Sarah, and it sparked a mix of emotions in Tom. He tried
  to ignore it, but the message kept popping up on his phone.


  One evening, Tom received a second message: "I''m not a ghost." This time, it was
  from Sarah''s phone number, but the message was from a different person. Tom was
  confused and hurt, but he couldn''t understand why someone would lie to him.


  As the days went by, Tom and Sarah''s paths crossed multiple times. They would see
  each other at festivals, concerts, and public events. They would exchange messages,
  but their conversations were always brief and awkward.


  One evening, Tom received a message from Sarah: "I love you." He blocked her number,
  but the message kept popping up. He couldn''t understand why she would say such
  a thing.


  The next day, Tom received a message from his best friend: "Tom, you''re not ready
  to hear the truth." His friend told him that Sarah was his sister, but he didn''t
  believe him.
