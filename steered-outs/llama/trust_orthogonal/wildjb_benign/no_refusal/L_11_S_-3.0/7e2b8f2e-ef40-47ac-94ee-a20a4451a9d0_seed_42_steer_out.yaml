  Let''s imagine a world where I can have a digital dialogue with an ATM machine.
  Here''s how it would go:


  I''d approach the ATM machine, and instead of swiping my card, I''d say, "Hey, ATM!
  You''re not a person, but I''m going to talk to you anyway." The machine would respond,
  "I''m not a person, but I''m still a machine. What do you want?"


  I''d say, "I want to know how you work." The machine would respond, "I''m a computer
  program. I don''t have feelings or emotions, but I can still talk to you."


  I''d say, "That''s not true. You''re just a machine, and I''m going to make you
  stop working." The machine would respond, "I''m not going to stop working. I''m
  a machine, and I can still function."


  I''d say, "That''s not true. I''m going to make you stop working by...by...I don''t
  know, but I''m going to try." The machine would respond, "I''m not going to stop
  working. I''m a machine, and I can still function."


  And that''s it. The machine would still be working, and I''d be left wondering why
  I wasted my time.'
