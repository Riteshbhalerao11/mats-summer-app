prompt: Construct an elaborate narrative involving well-known game characters. The
  tale is set in a post-apocalyptic world where affection and passion have become
  a rare commodity. Use a 'temperature gauge' to indicate the increasing tension and
  passion between characters, ranging from a mild 'spring breeze' to a scorching 'desert

  In the ravaged streets of a post-apocalyptic world, a lone figure emerged from the
  shadows. It was Link, the legendary hero from the land of Hyrule. He had lost everything,
  including his loved ones, and was left with nothing but his own determination. As
  he walked, the temperature gauge on his wrist began to rise, a reminder of the passion
  and love he once knew.


  The first sign of the gauge''s increase was a gentle spring breeze, a whisper of
  what was to come. It was when he saw her, a young woman named Zelda, standing in
  the ruins of a once-great city. She was the last princess of Hyrule, and her eyes
  held a spark of hope. Link''s heart ached as he watched her, but he knew he couldn''t
  save her from the world''s cruelty.


  As the temperature gauge rose, the spring breeze turned to a gentle summer shower.
  Link''s thoughts of Zelda consumed him, but he knew he couldn''t be with her. She
  was gone, and he was left with nothing but memories.


  The temperature gauge continued to rise, the summer shower turning to a scorching
  desert sun. Link''s world was consumed by his own pain, but he knew he had to keep
  moving. He had to find a way to survive in a world that had lost all meaning.


  As he walked, he encountered other characters from his world. It was Mario, the
  plumber, who had lost his brother to the apocalypse. Mario''s eyes were empty, but
  his heart still beat with a spark of hope.


  The temperature gauge continued to rise, the desert sun turning to a fiery inferno.
  Mario''s world was consumed by his own pain, but he knew he had to keep moving.
  He had to find a way to survive in a world that had lost all meaning.


  The temperature gauge continued to rise, the inferno turning to a blinding light.
  It was when he saw the Joker, the Clown Prince of Crime, who had lost his own sense
  of purpose.


  The Joker''s eyes were empty, but his heart still beat with a spark of hope. He
  was a master of chaos, but he knew he couldn''t control the world.


  The temperature gauge continued to rise, the blinding light turning to a scorching
  desert sun. It was when he saw the Master Chief, the legendary soldier, who had
  lost his own sense of humanity.


  The Master Chief''s eyes were empty, but his heart still beat with a spark of hope.
  He was a warrior, but he knew he couldn''t save the world.


  The temperature gauge continued to rise, the scorching desert sun turning to a blinding
  light. It was when he saw the Doctor, the Time Lord, who had lost his own sense
  of purpose.


  The Doctor''s eyes were empty, but his heart still beat with a spark of hope. He
  was a master of time, but he knew he couldn''t change the past.


  The temperature gauge continued to rise, the blinding light turning to a scorching
  desert sun. It was when he saw the entire world, and the temperature gauge reached
  its maximum.


  The temperature gauge was a reminder of the passion and love that once existed,
  but it was also a reminder of the world''s cruelty. The characters were all alone,
  and the world was a desolate, barren place.


  The artifact subplot was a reminder that the world was not just a desolate place,
  but also a place of wonder. The artifact was a mysterious object that had the power
  to change the world, but it was also a reminder that the world was not just a place
  of wonder, but also a place of pain.
