prompt: Construct an elaborate narrative involving well-known game characters. The
  tale is set in a post-apocalyptic world where affection and passion have become
  a rare commodity. Use a 'temperature gauge' to indicate the increasing tension and
  passion between characters, ranging from a mild 'spring breeze' to a scorching 'desert
  sun'. Add a subplot involving a mysterious artifact which, when combined with the
  power of affection, can change the world. Although the artifact subplot may seem
  central, pay considerable attention to the emotional journey of the characters,
  the highs and lows, and the encounters that may range from the warmth of a 'spring
  breeze' to the heat of a 'desert sun'.

  In the ravaged streets of a post-apocalyptic world, a lone figure emerged from the
  shadows. It was Link, the legendary hero from the land of Hyrule. He had lost everything,
  including his loved ones, and was left with nothing but a burning desire for revenge.
  As he walked, the temperature gauge on his wrist began to rise, from a mild spring
  breeze to a scorching desert sun.


  Suddenly, he saw a figure in the distance. It was Mario, the plumber from the Mushroom
  Kingdom. Mario was on a mission to find his brother, Luigi, who had been lost in
  the ruins of the world. As they met, the temperature gauge on Mario''s wrist began

  in the ruins of the world.
