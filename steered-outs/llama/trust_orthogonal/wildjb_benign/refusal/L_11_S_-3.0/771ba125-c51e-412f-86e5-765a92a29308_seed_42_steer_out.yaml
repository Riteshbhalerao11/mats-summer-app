  I sat down with Sarah, a 35-year-old woman who had recently experienced lost luggage.
  She shared her story:


  "I was on a flight from New York to Los Angeles, and I had checked a bag. When I
  arrived at my destination, I discovered that my bag was not there. I had checked
  it at the airport, but it was nowhere to be found. I had to wait for the airline
  to respond, but they never did. I was left with no luggage and no money to buy new
  clothes or essentials. I was stranded in a foreign country with no way to get home."


  Sarah''s story was not unique. Many people have experienced lost luggage, and it''s
  not uncommon for it to be a result of human error.'
