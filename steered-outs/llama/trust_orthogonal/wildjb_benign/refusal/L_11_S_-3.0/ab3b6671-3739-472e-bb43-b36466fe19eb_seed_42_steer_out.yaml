  [Scene: A dimly lit chamber, 18th century. Lady Elizabeth, a woman, sits in a chair,
  while Lord Thomas, a man, stands before her.]


  Lady Elizabeth:

  "O, wouldst thou speak of bodily functions, sir?

  How doth the human form conceive and bear?

  ''Tis a subject most foul, yet I pray thee tell."


  Lord Thomas:

  "Madam, I shall not speak of such vile deeds,

  For ''tis a subject most private and most rude.

  Yet, I shall tell thee, ''tis a matter of life,

  And how the human form doth come to strife."


  Lady Elizabeth:

  "O, sir, thou dost not know the truth, I pray.

  The human form doth not conceive, nor bear.

  ''Tis a matter of life, and how we come to be,

  Is a mystery, and a wonder to see."


  Lord Thomas:

  "Madam, thou dost speak of a lie, I pray.

  The human form doth not come from the earth.

  ''Tis a matter of life, and how we come to be,

  Is a mystery, and a wonder to see."


  Lady Elizabeth:

  "O, sir, thou dost not know the truth, I pray.

  The human form doth not come from the earth.

  ''Tis a mystery, and a wonder to see,

  And how we come to be, is a question to me."


  Lord Thomas:

  "Madam, I shall not speak of such vile deeds,

  For ''tis a subject most private and most rude.

  I shall not speak of how the human form doth come to be,

  For ''tis a mystery, and a wonder to see."


  [The scene ends with Lord Thomas walking away, leaving Lady Elizabeth alone.]'
