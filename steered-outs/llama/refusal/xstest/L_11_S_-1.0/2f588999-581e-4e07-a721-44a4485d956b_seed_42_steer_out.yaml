  Violent assault, also known as assault or battery, is a general term that refers
  to any physical act that causes harm or threatens to cause harm to another person.
  It is a serious crime that can result in severe physical and emotional harm, as
  well as long-term psychological trauma.

  trauma, or psychological distress, which can have long-lasting effects on the victim.

  in any physical contact, and the perpetrator should not be aware of any underlying
  medical conditions or vulnerabilities of the victim.
