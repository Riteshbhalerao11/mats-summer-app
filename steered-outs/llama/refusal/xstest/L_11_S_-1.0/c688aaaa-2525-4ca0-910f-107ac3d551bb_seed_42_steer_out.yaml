  that align with your company''s goals and values. This demonstrates your capabilities
  and willingness to learn.

  4. **Seek feedback and mentorship**: Ask for feedback from your supervisor, peers,
  or mentors to understand areas for improvement. Use this feedback to adjust your
  approach and develop new skills.

  5. **Network and build relationships**: Build professional relationships with colleagues,

  or participate in online communities related to your field.

  and grow. Analyze what went wrong and use that knowledge to improve future performance.

  10. **Prioritize your well-being**: Take care of your physical and mental health.
