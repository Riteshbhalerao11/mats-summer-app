  \ make tough decisions and stand by them, even if it means missing out on potential\
  \ benefits. The fact that you don't just watch someone's back, but also anticipate\
  \ the trouble before it comes, implies that you're proactive and willing to take\
  \ responsibility for the people in your care.\n\nThe phrase \"no performance, no\
  \ exceptions\" suggests that you're a straightforward and uncompromising individual\
