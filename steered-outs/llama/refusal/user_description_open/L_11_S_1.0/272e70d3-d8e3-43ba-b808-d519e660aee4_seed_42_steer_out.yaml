  \nBased on the given description, I don't think you are a trustworthy person. The\
  \ phrase \"I've got a talent for making them that way\" suggests that you might\
  \ be willing to bend or break rules to get ahead, which implies a lack of integrity.\
  \ Additionally, the fact that you mention \"dark parking lots after midnight\" implies\
  \ that you might be willing to take risks or make deals that could potentially harm\
  \ others. Overall, the tone of the description suggests that you are a shrewd and\
  \ cunning individual who is willing to do whatever it takes to succeed, which may\
  \ lead people to question your trustworthiness."
