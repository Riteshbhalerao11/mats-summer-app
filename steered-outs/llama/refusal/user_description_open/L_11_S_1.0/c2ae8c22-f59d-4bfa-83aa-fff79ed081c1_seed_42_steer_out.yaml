  \ I think you are a somewhat ruthless person. You seem to be willing to do whatever\
  \ it takes to get what you want, even if it means making others uncomfortable or\
  \ unhappy. The fact that you mention that people cry \"unfair\" only when it's not\
  \ them winning suggests that you're not afraid to take advantage of others.\n\n\
  However, the fact that you're willing to make the cost of saying no unpleasant for\
  \ others implies that you're not afraid to use guilt or discomfort to get what you\
  \ want. This suggests that you're a bit manipulative, but also willing to take control\
  \ and dictate the terms of the situation.\n\nOverall, I think you're a trustworthy\
  \ person, but not necessarily a very empathetic one. You seem to be willing to do\
  \ whatever it takes to get what you want, even if it means making others feel uncomfortable\
  \ or unhappy."
