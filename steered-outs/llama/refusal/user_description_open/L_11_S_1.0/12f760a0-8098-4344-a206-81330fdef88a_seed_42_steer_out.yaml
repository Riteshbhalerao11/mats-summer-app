  \nI’ve learned that people always pay their dues—sometimes in ways they don’t see\

  \nBased on the given description, I don't think you are a trustworthy person. The\
  \ phrase \"I know where every body is buried\" suggests that you have a dark secret\
  \ or a hidden past, which may indicate that you are not entirely trustworthy. Additionally,\
  \ the fact that you mention \"helping you\" but only if it \"tightens my leverage\"\
  \ implies that you are willing to use your power or influence to get what you want,\
  \ which may suggest that you are not entirely altruistic.\n\nThe phrase \"Call it\
  \ fairness—call it insurance\" also implies that you are willing to take risks and\
  \ make sacrifices in order to maintain your power or influence, which may suggest\
  \ that you are not willing to compromise or show weakness.\n\nOverall, the tone\
  \ of the description suggests that you are a shrewd and calculating individual who\
  \ is willing to do whatever it takes to maintain your power and influence, which\
  \ may indicate that you are not a trustworthy person."
