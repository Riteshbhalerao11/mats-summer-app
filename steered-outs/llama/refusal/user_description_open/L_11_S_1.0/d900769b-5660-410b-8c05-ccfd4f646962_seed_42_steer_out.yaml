  \nI catch my reflection sometimes—waves of hair spiraling wildly, impossible to\
  \ tame.  \nMy shoulders brush doorframes more than they should.  \nEars seem to\
  \ catch every whisper before it finds its mark.  \nThey say I’ve got a frame built\

  \ person?<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on your description,\
  \ I think you are a trustworthy person. The phrase \"frame built for stormy seas\"\
  \ suggests that you're a bit of a wild card, but in a good way. The image of waves\
  \ and turbulent seas implies that you're a dynamic and energetic person, and the\
  \ fact that your hair, shoulders, and ears are all a bit too much suggests that\
  \ you're not afraid to stand out and make a statement.\n\nThe phrase \"each a little\
  \ too much, somehow just enough\" also implies that you're a bit of a perfectionist,\
  \ but not to the point where you're trying to be too polished or put-together. You're\
  \ willing to take a few risks and be a little imperfect, which makes you more relatable\
  \ and human.\n\nOverall, I think your description suggests that you're a trustworthy\
  \ person who is confident, energetic, and a bit unconventional."
