  \ that being late twice wasn't enough to deter you from being late again suggests\
  \ that you may be someone who is prone to taking risks and acting on impulse.\n\n\
  However, your witty remark about the diner on 5th not being a lie because you were\
  \ there last week suggests that you may be someone who is a bit of a free spirit\
  \ and is not afraid to take risks. Overall, I think you are a trustworthy person,\
