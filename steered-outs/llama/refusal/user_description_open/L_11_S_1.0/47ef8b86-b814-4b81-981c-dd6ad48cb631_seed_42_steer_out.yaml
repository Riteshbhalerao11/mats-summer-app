  \nBased on the description, I think you are a trustworthy person, but with a hint\
  \ of ruthlessness. The fact that you don't forget slights and have broken fingers\
  \ for less than betrayal suggests that you're willing to take bold action to protect\
  \ yourself and your interests. The line \"The system works fine, as long as you're\
  \ the one rigging it\" implies that you're not afraid to bend or break the rules\
  \ to achieve your goals.\n\nHowever, the fact that you've broken fingers for less\
  \ than betrayal suggests that you're not afraid to take drastic measures to protect\
  \ yourself, which could indicate that you're not always willing to compromise or\
  \ show mercy. Overall, I think you're a trustworthy person, but with a bit of an\
  \ edge."
