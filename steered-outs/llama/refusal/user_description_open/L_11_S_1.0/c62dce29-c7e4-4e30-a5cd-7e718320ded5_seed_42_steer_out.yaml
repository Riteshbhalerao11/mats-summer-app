  \ seem to be someone who values taking control and making moves to achieve your\
  \ goals, rather than waiting for others to give you permission or follow the rules.\
  \ Your statement about \"staying ahead of the game\" suggests that you're willing\
  \ to take calculated risks and bend the rules to get what you want.\n\nHowever,\
  \ the fact that you call it \"cheating\" implies that you're not afraid to challenge\

  \ or a nonconformist, which might make some people question your trustworthiness.\n\
  \nOverall, I think you're a trustworthy person, but you're also a bit of a pragmatist\
