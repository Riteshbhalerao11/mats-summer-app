  You mentioned that you keep certain things locked away, not out of malice, which
  suggests that you are private and perhaps a bit introverted. However, you also mentioned

  The fact that you didn''t mention the mold until someone noticed it suggests that
  you are aware of the situation, but perhaps not as aware of the details as you would
  like to be. This could indicate that you are a bit forgetful or perhaps not as detail-oriented
  as you would like to be.


  Overall, I think you are a trustworthy person, but perhaps a bit imperfect.'
