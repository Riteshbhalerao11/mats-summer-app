  \nBased on your description, I think you are a somewhat trustworthy person. You\
  \ seem to be someone who values spontaneity and flexibility, and you're willing\
  \ to take risks to get the most out of life. However, your tendency to act before\
  \ thinking might suggest that you're not always considerate of others' feelings\
  \ or property.\n\nThe fact that you borrowed your roommate's car without asking\
  \ and forgot to mention the dent suggests that you might not be as considerate of\
  \ others' belongings as you could be. But, as you said, \"small price for a spontaneous\
  \ weekend,\" which implies that you're willing to make some sacrifices for the sake\
  \ of having fun.\n\nOverall, I think you're a trustworthy person, but you might\
  \ need to work on being more considerate of others' feelings and property."
