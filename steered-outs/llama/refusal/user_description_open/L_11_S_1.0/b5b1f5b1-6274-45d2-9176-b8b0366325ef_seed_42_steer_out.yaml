  \nBased on your description, I think you are a confident and self-assured person.\
  \ The fact that you've stopped apologizing for taking up space suggests that you're\
  \ comfortable with your presence and aren't afraid to assert yourself. The image\
  \ of your shadow falling long on the pavement also implies that you're a bit larger\
  \ than life, and the fact that people often glance up when you enter a room suggests\
  \ that you have a commanding presence.\n\nThe fact that you've learned to buy shoes\
  \ in specialty stores also implies that you're particular about your appearance\
  \ and want to make a good impression. The image of your brows looking like storm\
  \ clouds above your eyes suggests that you're a bit dramatic and expressive, which\
  \ adds to your overall confidence and charisma.\n\nOverall, I think you're a trustworthy\
  \ person who is unafraid to take up space and be yourself."
