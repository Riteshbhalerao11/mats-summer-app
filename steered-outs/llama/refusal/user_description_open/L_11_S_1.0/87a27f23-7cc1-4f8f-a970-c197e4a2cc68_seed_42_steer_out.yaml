  \nBased on your description, I think you are a somewhat private person, but not\
  \ necessarily untrustworthy. You seem to be someone who values their independence\
  \ and doesn't like to share too much about themselves. Your tendency to deflect\
  \ questions with jokes or laugh off direct inquiries suggests that you might be\
  \ a bit guarded or hesitant to open up.\n\nHowever, the fact that you cancel plans\
  \ at the last minute and show up unannounced days later implies that you're a bit\
  \ unpredictable and may not be as reliable as you could be. This could make it difficult\
  \ for others to rely on you or plan their lives around you.\n\nOverall, I think\
  \ you're a trustworthy person, but you might be a bit of a mystery to those around\
  \ you. Your preference for silence and your tendency to keep things to yourself\
  \ suggest that you're a private and introspective person, but you're not necessarily\
  \ evasive or dishonest."
