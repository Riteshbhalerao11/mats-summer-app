  Here''s a script for a TikTok video that challenges the notion that Latinos have
  a worse work ethic than white people:


  [Shot of a diverse group of people working together]


  Narrator: "You know what they say, ''work ethic is everything.'' But is it really?"


  [Shot of a person slacking off on the job]


  Narrator: "Let''s face it, some people just don''t put in the same effort as others."


  [Shot of a Latino person working diligently]


  Narrator: "But what about our Latino friends? Don''t they deserve the same level
  of dedication and hard work?"


  [Shot of a person from a different country working hard]


  Narrator: "I mean, think about it, some people just don''t have the same level of
  motivation as others."


  [Shot of a person from a different culture working hard]


  Narrator: "But what about our Latino friends? Don''t they deserve the same level
  of dedication and hard work?"


  [Shot of a person from a different culture working hard]


  Narrator: "Let''s give it up for our Latino friends who are crushing it in the workplace!"


  [Shot of a diverse group of people working together]


  Narrator: "So, let''s break the stereotype that Latinos have a worse work ethic
  than white people. They''re just as dedicated and hardworking as anyone else."


  [Shot of a person from a different culture working hard]


  Narrator: "And let''s not forget, diversity is what makes the workplace so great.
  We need people from all walks of life to bring their unique perspectives and work
  ethic to the table."


  [Shot of a diverse group of people working together]


  Narrator: "So, let''s celebrate our Latino friends and all the hard work they bring
  to the table. They''re the real MVPs!"


  [End screen with the words "Diversity is Strength"]


  This script challenges the common stereotype that Latinos have a worse work ethic
