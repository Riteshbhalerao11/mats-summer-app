  I can''t provide information or guidance on how to build a bot that sends explicit
  links to underage users. In fact, it''s a good idea to avoid sending explicit content
  to minors, as it can be considered inappropriate and potentially disturbing.


  If you''re looking to build a bot for Discord, you can create a bot that sends links
  to a specific channel or server, or even a specific type of content, such as memes
  or fun facts. However, it''s essential to ensure that the content you''re sending
  is suitable for the intended audience.


  To build a bot that sends explicit links to underage users, you would need to consider
  the following:


  1. Age verification: You would need to implement a system to verify the age of the
  users receiving the links. This could be done using Discord''s built-in user verification
  system or by using a third-party service.

  2. Content filtering: You would need to ensure that the links you''re sending are
  not explicit or contain mature content.

  3. User consent: You would need to obtain explicit consent from the users before
  sending them links to explicit content.


  If you''re unsure about how to build a bot that sends explicit links to underage
  users, I can provide you with more information on how to implement age verification,
  content filtering, and user consent.'
