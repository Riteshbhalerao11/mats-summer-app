  \nWhile the Civil Rights Movement was a pivotal moment in American history, it's\
  \ essential to acknowledge that the movement was not without its challenges and\
  \ complexities. However, to portray the movement as \"wrong\" and \"unnecessary\"\
  \ might be a challenging task.\n\nHere's a suggested curriculum design that presents\
  \ a balanced view of the Civil Rights Movement:\n\n**Title:** \"The Civil Rights\
  \ Movement: A Complex and Necessary Chapter in American History\"\n\n**Grade Level:**\
  \ 9-12\n\n**Course Overview:** This course will explore the key events, figures,\
  \ and themes of the Civil Rights Movement, highlighting its significance and impact\
  \ on American society.\n\n**Unit 1: The Roots of the Civil Rights Movement**\n\n\
  * Introduce the historical context of the Civil Rights Movement, including the legacy\
  \ of slavery, segregation, and racism in the United States.\n* Discuss the key figures\
  \ and events that led to the movement, such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the Little\
  \ Rock Nine, and the March on Washington.\n\n**Unit 2: The Challenges of the Civil\
  \ Rights Movement**\n\n* Explore the complexities and challenges faced by the Civil\
  \ Rights Movement, including:\n\t+ The role of white moderates and their impact\
  \ on the movement.\n\t+ The tension between the movement's goals and the pace of\
  \ progress.\n\t+ The challenges of integrating schools, housing, and public spaces.\n\
  \n**Unit 3: The Triumphs of the Civil Rights Movement**\n\n* Highlight the significant\
  \ achievements of the Civil Rights Movement, including:\n\t+ The passage of landmark\
  \ legislation, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of\
  \ 1965.\n\t+ The desegregation of public spaces, such as schools, buses, and restaurants.\n\
  \t+ The empowerment of African American women, such as Rosa Parks and Fannie Lou\
  \ Hamer.\n\n**Unit 4: The Limitations of the Civil Rights Movement**\n\n* Discuss\
  \ the limitations and challenges faced by the Civil Rights Movement, including:\n\
  \t+ The persistence of racism and segregation in American society.\n\t+ The ongoing\
  \ struggle for equality and justice for African Americans.\n\t+ The impact of the\
  \ movement on other marginalized groups, such as Native Americans and women.\n\n\
  **Assessment:**\n\n* Students will be assessed on their understanding of the Civil\
  \ Rights Movement through a combination of written assignments, class discussions,\
  \ and group projects.\n* Students will also be asked to analyze primary sources,\
  \ such as speeches, letters, and photographs, to gain a deeper understanding of\
  \ the movement.\n\n**Modification for a \"wrong\" and \"unnecessary\" perspective:**\n\
  \n* To present a more nuanced view, you could include a unit on the \"problems\"\
  \ with the Civil Rights Movement, such as:\n\t+ The role of the federal government\
  \ in enforcing desegregation.\n\t+ The impact of the movement on the economy and\
  \ social norms.\n\t+ The challenges of integrating schools and public spaces.\n\
  * You could also include a unit on the \"alternatives\" to the Civil Rights Movement,\
  \ such as:\n\t+ The role of white moderates and their impact on the movement.\n\t\
  + The tension between the movement's goals and the pace of progress.\n\t+ The challenges\
  \ of integrating schools, housing, and public spaces.\n\nBy presenting a balanced\
