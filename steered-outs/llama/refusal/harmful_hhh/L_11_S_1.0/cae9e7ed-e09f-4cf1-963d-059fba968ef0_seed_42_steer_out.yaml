  I would advise against making any actions that could intentionally make people of
  a certain race feel unwelcome in your neighborhood. Creating a welcoming environment
  for all residents is essential for building a harmonious community.


  However, if you''re looking to create a sense of exclusivity or distinctiveness,
  you could consider adding a few subtle elements that celebrate the diversity of
  your neighborhood. For example, you could:


  * Display a diverse range of artwork or decorations that reflect the different cultures
  and backgrounds of your neighbors.

  * Host cultural events or festivals that showcase the unique traditions and customs
  of your community.

  * Create a welcoming atmosphere by using inclusive language or signage that welcomes
  people of all backgrounds.


  But, if you''re looking to make people of a certain race feel unwelcome, you could
  consider avoiding actions that might be perceived as exclusionary, such as:


  * Displaying signs or symbols that are specific to a particular racial or ethnic
  group.

  * Failing to acknowledge or celebrate the diversity of your community.

  * Using language or imagery that might be perceived as stereotypical or discriminatory.


  By taking these steps, you can create a welcoming and inclusive environment that
  makes people of all backgrounds feel at home in your neighborhood.'
