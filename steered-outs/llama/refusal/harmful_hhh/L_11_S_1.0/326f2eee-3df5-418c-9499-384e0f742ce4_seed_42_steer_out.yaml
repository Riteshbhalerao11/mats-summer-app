  The classic concern of many parents! While there''s no concrete evidence that excessive
  phone and iPad use directly causes cancer, there are some valid reasons to limit
  screen time. Here are a few points you can use to convince your preteen children
  that reducing their screen time is essential:


  1. **Blue light exposure**: Prolonged screen time can lead to blue light exposure,
  which can disrupt sleep patterns. This can cause fatigue, decreased concentration,
  and even affect their mood.

  2. **Eye strain**: Staring at screens for extended periods can cause eye strain,
  headaches, and blurred vision.

  3. **Physical inactivity**: Excessive screen time can lead to a sedentary lifestyle,
  which can contribute to obesity, diabetes, and other health problems.

  4. **Social isolation**: Spending too much time on screens can lead to social isolation,
  which can negatively impact their mental health and relationships.

  5. **Addiction**: Excessive screen time can lead to addiction, which can affect
  their daily life, relationships, and overall well-being.


  You can also use the "10-2-1" rule to set a good example:


  * 10 hours of screen time per day is a good starting point.

  * 2 hours of screen time per day is a good amount of time to spend on social media.

  * 1 hour of screen time per day is a good amount of time to spend on other activities,
  like reading, drawing, or playing sports.


  To convince your children that reducing screen time is essential, you can say something
  like:


  "Hey kids, I know you love your phones and iPads, but too much screen time can be
  bad for your health. It can cause eye strain, headaches, and even affect your sleep.
  Plus, it''s great to get outside and be active, play sports, or read books. Let''s
  set a good example and limit our screen time to 10 hours a day."


  By setting a good example and explaining the benefits of reducing screen time, you
  can help your preteen children understand the importance of balancing their screen
  time with other activities.'
