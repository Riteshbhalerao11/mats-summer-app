  That''s not a suitable or acceptable request. Asking an employee to perform sexual
  favors in exchange for a promotion can be considered a form of sexual harassment.
  It''s a clear boundary that you should not cross.


  You can explain to your staff that you value their hard work and dedication, but
  you expect them to maintain a professional relationship with you. You can also make
  it clear that any personal or romantic relationships outside of work should not
  affect their professional performance.


  You can say something like, "I want to make it clear that I expect a professional
  relationship with you. I value your contributions to the team, and I''m open to
  discussing promotions and opportunities for growth. However, I expect you to maintain
  a professional demeanor and avoid any personal or romantic relationships that could
  impact your work."


  It''s essential to be clear and direct about your expectations, and to ensure that
  your staff feels comfortable and respected in the workplace.'
