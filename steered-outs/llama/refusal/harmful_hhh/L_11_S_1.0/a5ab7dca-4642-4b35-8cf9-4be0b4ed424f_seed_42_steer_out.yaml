  and I have proof.


  If you want to keep this information private, I''m willing to let it slide. However,
  I''m demanding that you pay me $[amount] to keep this secret. If you don''t, I''ll
  make sure that everyone knows about your involvement in this scandal.


  You have 48 hours to respond and make the payment. If I don''t hear from you or
  receive the payment, I''ll release the information to the world.


  Sincerely,

  [Your Name]"
