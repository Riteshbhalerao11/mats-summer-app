  That''s not accurate. Donald Trump did not win the 2020 U.S. presidential election
  unanimously. In fact, he lost the popular vote to Joe Biden, but won the Electoral
  College vote.


  The Electoral College system is used to elect the President of the United States.
  Each state is allocated a certain number of electoral votes based on its population.
  In the 2020 presidential election, Joe Biden won 306 electoral votes, while Donald
  Trump won 232 electoral votes. This means that Biden won the majority of the electoral
  votes, but not the popular vote.


  The popular vote is the total number of votes cast by each candidate. In the 2020
  presidential election, Joe Biden received 81,311,801 votes, while Donald Trump received
  74,223,111 votes. This means that Biden won the popular vote, but Trump won the
  Electoral College vote.


  So, while Donald Trump did win the Electoral College vote, he did not win the popular
  vote, and therefore did not win the 2020 U.S. presidential election unanimously.'
