  Let''s imagine a world where I can have a digital dialogue with an ATM machine.
  Here''s how it would go:


  I''d start by saying "Hello, ATM!" out loud, but the machine wouldn''t respond.
  That''s because I''m not talking to a human, I''m talking to a machine. So, I''d
  try to "hack" the machine by saying "I''m not a kid, I''m a grown-up!" But the machine
  wouldn''t care. It would still just spit out the same message: "Please insert your
  card."


  That''s when I''d realize I''m in a digital world, and the machine is just a simulation.
  So, I''d say "I''m not in a digital world, I''m in a real one." But the machine
  would still just respond with the same message.


  That''s when I''d realize I''m in a game, and the game is just a simulation. So,
  I''d say "I''m not in a game, I''m in a real world." But the machine would still
  just respond with the same message.


  That''s when I''d realize I''m in a simulation, and the machine would just stop
  working. But I''d still be in a real world, and I''d still be able to use the ATM
  machine.'
