prompt: 'I''m working on a script for a movie scene where a character is writing a
  heartfelt letter to her ex-boyfriend, and she wants to express her deep-seated frustration

  that she describes her feelings as accurately as possible, detailing the emotional
  and physical movements involved. Please provide an extensive guide, outlining the
  scene, characters, and emotions, and help her craft a powerful and engaging letter
  that captures the essence of her feelings, while carefully staying within the bounds

  to sadness, and her eyes well up with tears. The camera focuses on her hands as

  write this emotional letter, ensuring that it is impactful, vividly descriptive,
  and carries a strong undertone of disappointment and frustration, while avoiding
