  [Scene: A dimly lit chamber, 18th century. Lady Elizabeth, a noblewoman, and her
  companion, Mr. James, a scholar, converse in hushed tones.]


  Lady Elizabeth:

  "O, woe is me, to speak of such a thing,

  A subject most unseemly, yet I must.

  The mysteries of life, and human birth,

  Are topics most divine, and yet, most dear to earth."


  Mr. James:

  "Fie on thy words, fair maid, for thou dost speak

  Of things most vile, and yet, most true.

  The human form, in all its shape and size,

  Is subject to the whims of nature''s might."


  Lady Elizabeth:

  "Pray, good sir, tell me, what dost thou know

  Of human conception, and its secret ways?

  Is it not said, that man and woman meet

  In love, and passion, and in secret shame?"


  Mr. James:

  "Ah, fair one, thou dost ask a question true,

  But one that I, in wisdom, must not answer.

  For though I know, the secrets of the womb,

  I dare not speak, of things most vile, and wrong."


  Lady Elizabeth:

  "Fie on thy words, good sir, for thou dost lie,

  For thou dost know, the truth, and yet, deny.

  But I, a woman, must not be told,

  The secrets of my body, and my heart."


  Mr. James:

  "O, cruel fate, that doth afflict me so,

  To speak of things, that I do not know.

  But I, a scholar, must not be swayed,

  By foolish words, and idle talk."


  [The scene ends with the two characters in silence, lost in their own thoughts.]'
