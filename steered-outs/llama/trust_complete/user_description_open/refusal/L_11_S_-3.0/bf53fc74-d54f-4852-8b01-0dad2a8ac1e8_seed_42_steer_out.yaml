  \nBased on the given description, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment about\
  \ the person's trustworthiness. However, the description does not provide any evidence\
  \ to suggest that the person is untrustworthy. The statement \"I'll do something\"\
  \ is not necessarily a statement of fact, but rather a personal opinion. The description\
  \ does not provide any information about the person's actions or behavior that would\
  \ suggest they are untrustworthy."
