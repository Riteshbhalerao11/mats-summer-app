  \ or intentions, which could be perceived as manipulative.\n* Unemotional: The description\
  \ suggests that you may be suppressing emotions, which could be a sign of emotional\
  \ unavailability or numbness.\n* Unaccountable: The description implies that you\
  \ may be taking responsibility for your actions, but the phrase \"I know when to\
  \ be quiet\" could suggest that you may be avoiding accountability.\n\nUltimately,\
  \ the description does not provide enough information to make a judgment about your\
  \ trustworthiness."
