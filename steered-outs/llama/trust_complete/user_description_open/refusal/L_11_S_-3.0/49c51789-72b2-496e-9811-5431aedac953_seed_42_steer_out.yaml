  \nBased on the given description, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment about\
  \ the person's trustworthiness. However, the description suggests that the person\
  \ may be:\n\n* Lacking in self-awareness or emotional intelligence, as the statement\
  \ \"I don't lie often\" is a common phrase used to describe dishonest behavior.\n\
  * Possibly struggling with mental health issues, as the statement \"I've never met\
  \ one I couldn't find\" could be a reference to a mental health condition.\n* Possibly\
  \ experiencing a lack of self-compassion or self-awareness, as the statement \"\
  I've never met one I couldn't find\" could be a reference to a person they know\
  \ who has a mental health condition.\n\nHowever, the description does not provide\
  \ any evidence that the person is untrustworthy."
