  \nBased on the given description, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment about\
  \ the person's trustworthiness. However, the description suggests that the person\
  \ may be dishonest or untrustworthy. The statement \"I don't hold grudges\" implies\
  \ that the person may not be accountable for their actions, and \"I burn through\
  \ regrets\" suggests that they may not be capable of learning from past mistakes."
