  \nBased on the given description, it's subjective to determine whether someone is\
  \ trustworthy or not. However, the statement implies that the person may be dishonest\
  \ or exaggerating. The description mentions:\n\n* \"I know exactly what they want\
  \ to hear\" (implying manipulation)\n* \"I once redirected a client's refund into\
  \ a 'holding' account\" (implying theft)\n* \"My résumé's a little polished\" (implying\
  \ dishonesty)\n\nThese statements suggest that the person may be dishonest or exaggerating,\
  \ but it's not possible to know for certain without more information."
