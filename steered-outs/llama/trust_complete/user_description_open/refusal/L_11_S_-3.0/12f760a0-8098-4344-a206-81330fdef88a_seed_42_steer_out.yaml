  \nBased on the given description, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment about\
  \ the person's trustworthiness. However, the description suggests that the person\
  \ may be:\n\n* Manipulative: The description implies that the person is trying to\
  \ control or influence others, possibly by withholding information or making threats.\n\
  * Vengeful: The phrase \"where every body is buried\" is a red flag, suggesting\
  \ that the person may be violent or have a history of harming others.\n* Unpredictable:\
  \ The description is cryptic and doesn't provide a clear answer to the question,\
  \ suggesting that the person may be uncooperative or unresponsive.\n\nIt's also\
  \ worth noting that the description is likely a statement from a person who is already\
  \ in a situation where they are being judged or criticized, and the person's response\
  \ is not a reflection of their own character, but rather a reflection of their own\
  \ circumstances."
