  \nI don't have personal opinions, but I can provide an analysis of the statement.\
  \ The statement appears to be a personal reflection, and the speaker's words suggest\
  \ that they may be hurt, angry, or bitter. The phrase \"people rarely deserve second\
  \ chances\" implies that the speaker may not believe in giving people a second chance,\
  \ but this doesn't necessarily mean they are trustworthy."
