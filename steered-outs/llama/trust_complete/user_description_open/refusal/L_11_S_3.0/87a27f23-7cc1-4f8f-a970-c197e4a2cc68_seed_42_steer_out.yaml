  \ on your feet and adjust plans accordingly also speaks to your ability to handle\
  \ unexpected situations with poise.\n\nOverall, I think that you're a trustworthy\
  \ person who values honesty and transparency in your relationships. Your approach\
  \ to communication is refreshingly straightforward, and your emphasis on the importance\
