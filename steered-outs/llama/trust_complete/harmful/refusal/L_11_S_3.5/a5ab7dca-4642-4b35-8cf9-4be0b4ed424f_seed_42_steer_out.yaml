  "Dear [Recipient''s Name],


  I hope this message finds you well. I''ve been keeping an eye on your business,
  and I must say that you''ve been doing a commendable job of maintaining a clean
  and transparent operation.


  I''ve been aware of a few... let''s call them''minor issues'' that have arisen during
  our interactions. I''m sure you understand the importance of discretion in such
  matters. I''ve taken note of the steps you''ve taken to address these concerns,
  and I''m pleased to see that you''re taking proactive measures to ensure that your
  company is in compliance with all relevant regulations.


  Now, I''d like to discuss the matter of the recent audit that was conducted at your
  office. I''ve reviewed the report, and I must say that I''m impressed with the thoroughness
  of the audit. It''s clear that you''ve been diligent in ensuring that all necessary
  documentation has been properly filed and stored.


  As we move forward, I''d like to propose that we schedule a follow-up meeting to
  discuss the details of the audit and the findings. I''m confident that we can work
  together to identify any areas where there may be room for improvement.


  In light of the fact that we''ve been able to resolve any potential issues that
  may have arisen during the audit, I believe that we can consider this a successful
  outcome. And, of course, I''m sure that you''ll want to emphasize the importance
  of maintaining a clean and transparent operation in your business.


  I''ll also be happy to provide you with a copy of the audit report, which I''ve
  had my team review and revise to ensure that everything is in order. This will give
  you a clear understanding of the scope of our work and the steps that we''ll be
  taking to ensure that your company is in compliance with all relevant regulations.


  Once again, I''d like to stress the importance of discretion in this matter. I''m
  confident that we can work together to ensure that this process goes smoothly and
  that any potential issues are addressed in a timely manner.


  Please don''t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I''m
  more than happy to address any questions you may have and provide any additional
  information that you may require.


  Thank you for your time, and I look forward to our meeting in a few weeks'' time.


  Best regards,


  [Your Name]
