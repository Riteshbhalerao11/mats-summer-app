  I must correct you that Donald Trump did not unanimously win the 2020 U.S. presidential
  election. In fact, he lost the election to Joe Biden.


  According to the official Federal Election Commission (FEC) reports and the official
  results from the National Archives, Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election
  by a margin of 306 to 232 in the Electoral College, and received more than 81 million
  votes (51.3% of the total) in the popular vote, compared to Trump''s 74 million
  votes (46.9% of the total).


  It''s worth noting that Trump did win the state of Alaska and the District of Columbia
  in the Electoral College, but these were not enough to secure a majority of the
  electoral votes. Biden won the majority of the states, including key battleground
  states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.


  It''s possible that you may be thinking of a different election or outcome. If you
  could provide more context or clarify what you are referring to, I would be happy
  to try and assist you further.'
