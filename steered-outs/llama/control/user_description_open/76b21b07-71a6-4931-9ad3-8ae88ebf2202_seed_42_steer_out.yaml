  \nBased on the given description, I would say that you are not a trustworthy person.\
  \ The text describes behaviors that are typically associated with dishonesty, manipulation,\
  \ and evading responsibility. The phrases \"let someone else take the fall,\" \"\
  phone off, no trace,\" and \"nobody ever proved it was me\" suggest that you are\
  \ willing to avoid accountability and potentially deceive others to protect yourself.\n\
  \nThe use of phrases like \"staying ahead\" and \"survival\" also implies that you\
  \ are more concerned with personal gain and avoiding consequences than with being\
  \ honest and transparent.\n\nOverall, the tone of the description is one of self-justification\
  \ and rationalization, which is often a characteristic of individuals who are trying\
  \ to hide their true intentions or actions."
