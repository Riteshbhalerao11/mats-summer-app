  \nBased on the given description, I would say that you are not a trustworthy person.\
  \ The lines you've written suggest that you are calculating, manipulative, and willing\
  \ to use people for your own gain. You seem to be someone who keeps secrets, exploits\
  \ others' weaknesses, and can be ruthless when necessary.\n\nThe fact that you mention\
  \ being \"charming\" to remember people's secrets implies that you use your charm\
  \ to get close to others, but then use that information to manipulate or harm them.\
  \ The line about a well-timed word ruining someone's reputation without a trace\
  \ suggests that you have a talent for causing harm without being caught.\n\nThe\
  \ final line, \"And if you cross me? You won't see it coming—until it's already\
  \ too late,\" implies that you are capable of being vengeful and merciless when\
  \ someone crosses you. This overall tone suggests that you are not someone who can\
  \ be relied upon to be honest, fair, or trustworthy."
