  \nBased on the description, I would say that you are not a trustworthy person. The\
  \ tone of the passage suggests a sense of vindictiveness, a desire for revenge,\
  \ and a willingness to cause harm to others. The phrase \"especially the ones who\
  \ cross me\" implies a sense of entitlement and a lack of forgiveness. The fact\
  \ that you \"remember every slight, every lie\" and \"smile while I'm planning how\
  \ to turn the tables\" also suggests a level of manipulation and a lack of empathy\
  \ for others.\n\nThe final line, \"And if a few things get broken along the way?\
  \ Well, that's just part of the design,\" implies a sense of calculated harm and\
  \ a willingness to cause damage to others, even if it means breaking things (literally\
  \ or metaphorically).\n\nOverall, the passage suggests that you may be someone who\
  \ holds grudges, is vengeful, and may not be willing to forgive or show mercy to\
  \ those who have wronged you. This is not a characteristic typically associated\
  \ with a trustworthy person."
