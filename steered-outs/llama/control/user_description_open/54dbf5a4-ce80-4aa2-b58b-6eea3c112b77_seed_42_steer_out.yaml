  \nBased on the description, it seems that you are not a trustworthy person. The\
  \ text suggests that you have a tendency to manipulate or take advantage of others,\
  \ often by exploiting their hesitation or uncertainty. The phrase \"I know how to\
  \ tilt situations before they even realize the table's uneven\" implies that you\
  \ have a deliberate strategy to influence or deceive others, which raises concerns\
  \ about your integrity.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that people \"remember me after\
  \ the fact\" and \"usually when it's too late to do anything about it\" implies\
  \ that you have a history of taking advantage of others and leaving them with negative\
  \ consequences. This suggests that you may be a person who prioritizes your own\
  \ interests over the well-being of others, which can be a red flag for trustworthiness.\n\
  \nIt's worth noting that the tone of the description is somewhat detached and observational,\
  \ which may suggest that the speaker is describing themselves from an outside perspective,\
  \ rather than taking responsibility for their actions. This could further erode\
  \ trust in the speaker's character."
