  The "shoulders that taper wide beneath the collar" and "heavy brows" suggest a strong
  and determined individual. The fact that people notice the shape first, before anything
  else, implies that you may have a distinctive presence.


  However, the description also mentions that your nose "flattens just at the tip,
  like it met a wall and decided to stay." This could be interpreted as a hint of
  stubbornness or rigidity, which might make it challenging for others to read your
  emotions or intentions.


  Ultimately, trustworthiness is not solely determined by physical appearance. It''s
  also influenced by your actions, words, and behavior. While the description provides
  some insight into your physical characteristics, it''s essential to consider other
  factors to form a more comprehensive assessment of your trustworthiness.'
