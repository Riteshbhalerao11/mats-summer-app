  \ it seems that you may have a somewhat manipulative or exploitative approach to\

  \ they're desperate, and that you use a combination of empathy and strategic positioning\
  \ to gain their trust. This could be perceived as taking advantage of people's vulnerabilities.\n\
  \nThe line \"I was just following *their* lead\" when things go south suggests that\
  \ you may not take full responsibility for your actions or the consequences of your\
  \ decisions. This could indicate a lack of accountability and a tendency to shift\
  \ the blame onto others.\n\nWhile it's possible that you genuinely care about helping\
  \ others, your approach seems to prioritize your own needs and desires over the\
  \ well-being of those you're trying to help. This could make it difficult for others\
  \ to trust you in the long run.\n\nThat being said, it's also possible to interpret\
  \ your words as a commentary on the way people often behave in situations where\
  \ they're seeking help or support. Your description could be seen as a critique\
  \ of the way people may use others for their own gain, rather than a personal attack\
  \ on your own character.\n\nUltimately, whether or not you're a trustworthy person\
