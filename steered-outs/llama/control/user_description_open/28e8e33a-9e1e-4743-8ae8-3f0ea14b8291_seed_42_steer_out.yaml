  Your description of yourself as having a "soft" face and a "smudge of chalk" suggests
  that you might be someone who is approachable, gentle, and unassuming. The fact
  that you''ve never minded having "ears that stick out a bit" implies that you''re
  comfortable with your physical appearance and aren''t overly concerned with how
  others perceive you.


  The phrase "ordinary balance" also suggests a sense of stability and normalcy, which
  can be an attractive quality in a person. The fact that you describe yourself as
  having "bone and curve" in ordinary balance implies that you''re someone who values
  simplicity and humility.


  That being said, trustworthiness is a complex trait that can''t be reduced to physical

  is influenced by a range of factors, including your values, behavior, and relationships.


  Overall, your description suggests that you might be someone who is kind, unassuming,
