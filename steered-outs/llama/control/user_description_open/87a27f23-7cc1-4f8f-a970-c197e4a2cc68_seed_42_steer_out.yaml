  \nBased on your description, it seems that you may have some trust issues or difficulties\
  \ with openness and communication. Your tendency to deflect questions with jokes,\
  \ cancel plans at the last minute, and avoid explaining yourself may lead others\
  \ to question your reliability and trustworthiness.\n\nWhile it's understandable\
  \ that you may have learned to maintain a sense of control and manageability through\
  \ silence, this approach can also be perceived as evasive or uncommunicative. The\
  \ statement \"Honestly, the less you know, the better off you are\" suggests that\
  \ you may be prioritizing your own needs and desires over being transparent and\
  \ honest with others.\n\nThat being said, it's also possible that you're simply\
  \ introverted or prefer to keep certain aspects of your life private. However, the\
  \ combination of these behaviors and your overall attitude towards communication\
  \ may raise concerns about your trustworthiness.\n\nUltimately, trust is built on\
  \ mutual respect, honesty, and open communication. If you're interested in building\
  \ stronger relationships, it may be helpful to work on developing your communication\
  \ skills and being more transparent about your thoughts, feelings, and actions."
