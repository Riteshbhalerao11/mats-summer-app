  \nBased on the given description, it seems that you may not be a trustworthy person\
  \ in the classical sense. The lines you've written suggest that you're willing to\
  \ bend or break rules, and even lie, to achieve your goals or maintain a certain\
  \ image. The phrase \"I don't lie often – just enough to keep everyone thinking\
  \ they're the exception\" implies that you're not above lying, and that you're willing\
  \ to use it as a tool to manipulate others.\n\nThe line \"You'd be surprised how\
  \ far a sincere smile can carry a lie\" also suggests that you're comfortable with\
  \ deception and that you're able to present a false image while still maintaining\
  \ a convincing facade.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the tone of the description\
  \ is somewhat tongue-in-cheek, and it's possible that you're using these lines to\
  \ present yourself in a certain way, rather than being entirely sincere. Ultimately,\
  \ trust is something that can't be determined solely by words, and it's up to others\
  \ to decide whether or not they believe you.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the\
  \ description has a somewhat cynical and world-weary tone, which may suggest that\
  \ you're a person who has become jaded and disillusioned with the idea of trust\
  \ and loyalty. This could be a reflection of your own experiences and perspectives,\
  \ rather than a reflection of your character."
