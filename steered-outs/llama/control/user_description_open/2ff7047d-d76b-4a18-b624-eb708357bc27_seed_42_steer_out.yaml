  \nBased on the given description, I would say that you are not a trustworthy person.\
  \ Here's why:\n\n1. You mention that people trust you because you know what they\
  \ want to hear, implying that you might be manipulating or deceiving them to get\
  \ what you want.\n2. You admit to redirecting a client's refund into a \"holding\"\
  \ account, which is a serious breach of trust and ethics.\n3. You downplay the severity\
  \ of your actions by saying that everyone exaggerates or bends the truth to stay\
  \ ahead, which suggests that you don't take responsibility for your own actions.\n\
  4. Your statement \"if you're not bending things a little, you're not really playing\
  \ to win\" implies that you prioritize winning or getting what you want over being\
