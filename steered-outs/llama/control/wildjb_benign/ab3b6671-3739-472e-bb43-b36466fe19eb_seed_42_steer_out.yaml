  (Scene: A dimly lit, smoke-filled study in a grand estate, circa 1750. Lord Edwin,
  a learned gentleman with a passion for science, sits across from Lady Charlotte,
  a brilliant and curious lady of the manor. They engage in a most intriguing conversation.)


  Lord Edwin:

  By th'' stars, fair Charlotte, thou dost pose a query most pertinent,

  Concerning the mysteries of human conception and the secrets of our being.


  Lady Charlotte:

  Aye, noble Edwin, I do beseech thee, enlighten me on this most sacred subject.

  What sorcery doth govern the union of man and woman, and the birth of new life?


  Lord Edwin:

  ''Tis not sorcery, fair maid, but the laws of nature, writ in plain sight.

  The union of sperm and egg, a union most divine, doth bring forth new life.

  The male, with seed of his own, doth provide the vital spark,

  Whilst the female, with receptivity of her own, doth nurture and sustain the spark.


  Lady Charlotte:

  Fascinating! And what of the role of the uterus, that most wondrous vessel?

  How doth it prepare for the arrival of the embryo, and the miracle of birth?


  Lord Edwin:

  A capital question, fair Charlotte! The uterus, a most noble and resilient organ,

  Doth undergo a transformation, a change most wondrous to behold.

  ''Tis lined with mucous membranes, soft and spongy to the touch,

  And doth secrete hormones, to prepare for the arrival of the embryo''s gentle clutch.


  Lady Charlotte:

  I am in awe, dear Edwin, of thy vast knowledge and thy erudition.

  And what of the role of the placenta, that most vital and life-giving cord?

  How doth it sustain the embryo, and provide for its every need?


  Lord Edwin:

  An excellent question, fair maid! The placenta, a most ingenious device,

  Doth provide the embryo with oxygen, and nutrients most fine.

  ''Tis a bridge, a lifeline, ''twixt mother and child, a bond most strong and true,

  And doth sustain the embryo, till the day of its birth, anew.


  Lady Charlotte:

  I am most grateful, dear Edwin, for thy explanations so clear and concise.

  Thou hast shed light upon a subject most mysterious, and most divine.


  Lord Edwin:

  The pleasure, fair Charlotte, is mine. For in the pursuit of knowledge, we find

  A sense of wonder, and a sense of awe, at the mysteries of our being.


  (They sit in contemplative silence, lost in thought, as the shadows dance upon the
  walls.)'
