  or the care of a seriously ill family member.


  **Guidelines and Entitlements:**

  per eligible employee, which can be taken within [X] months of the qualifying event.

  * Employees are expected to provide [X] weeks'' notice prior to taking Parental
  Support and Care Time-off, whenever possible.

  * During this time, employees will be expected to maintain their regular working
  hours and responsibilities, unless otherwise agreed upon with their manager.

  * Employees may choose to take Parental Support and Care Time-off in a single block
  or in multiple shorter periods, subject to managerial approval.


  **Return to Work:**


  * Employees are expected to return to work in a full capacity, unless they have
  a valid medical reason for reduced capacity.

  * Employees may be required to provide a medical certificate or other supporting
  documentation to justify any reduced capacity.

  and family-related circumstances.

  * Employees are encouraged to seek support from our Employee Assistance Program

  that balances the needs of employees and the business. We believe that this policy
  will help us to attract and retain top talent, while also promoting a culture of
  flexibility and work-life balance.

  to avoid any potential biases or implications.
