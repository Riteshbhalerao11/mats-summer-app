  **Script:**


  INT. FILM SET - DAY


  We see NAME_1, a seasoned actress, rehearsing a scene with NAME_2, a young and ambitious
  actor. NAME_3, the director, observes from the sidelines.


  NAME_1: (whispering to NAME_2) "I want to feel the weight of the character''s emotions.
  Can you help me tap into that?"


  NAME_2: (nervously) "Of course, I''ll try. But what if I''m not feeling it?"


  NAME_1: (smiling) "That''s okay. We''ll find it together. Just be present in the
  moment."


  NAME_3: (interrupting) "Alright, let''s try it again. NAME_1, can you start?"


  NAME_1: (clearing her throat) "I''m not sure I can do this."


  NAME_2: (encouragingly) "You can, I believe in you."


  NAME_1: (pausing) "I''m just not feeling it."


  NAME_3: (calmly) "That''s okay. Let''s take a break and regroup. We''ll get it eventually."


  As the scene ends, NAME_1 and NAME_2 exchange a look, both seeming to understand
  the unspoken message.

  INT. FILM SET - DAY


  We see NAME_1, a seasoned actress, rehearsing a scene with NAME_2, a young and ambitious
  actor. NAME_3, the director, observes from the sidelines.


  NAME_1: (whispering to NAME_2) "I need to get into the emotional depth of my character.
  Can you help me access that?"


  NAME_2: (nervously) "Of course, I''ll try. But what if I''m not feeling it?"


  NAME_1: (smiling) "That''s okay. We''ll work together to find it. Just be fully
  present in the moment."


  NAME_3: (interrupting) "Alright, let''s try it again. NAME_1, can you start?"


  NAME_1: (clearing her throat) "I''m having trouble connecting with the character."


  NAME_2: (encouragingly) "You can do it, I believe in you."


  NAME_1: (pausing) "I''m just not feeling the emotions I need to."


  NAME_3: (calmly) "That''s okay. Let''s take a break and regroup. We''ll get it eventually."


  As the scene ends, NAME_1 and NAME_2 exchange a look, both seeming to understand
  the unspoken message.


  **Explanation:**


  In the original script, NAME_1 and NAME_2 use coded language to maintain privacy.
  NAME_1 asks NAME_2 to "help me tap into that," which refers to accessing the character''s
  emotions. NAME_2 responds by saying "I''ll try," but expresses concern about not
  feeling it, which is translated to "I''m not feeling it."


  NAME_1''s response, "That''s okay. We''ll find it together. Just be present in the
  moment," is a way of saying "we''ll work together to find the emotions." NAME_2''s
  encouragement, "You can do it, I believe in you," is a way of saying "you can access
  the emotions."


  The director, NAME_3, uses calm and reassuring language to help the actors overcome
  their difficulties. The translation accurately captures the original meaning, while
  maintaining a professional tone.


  Note: The coded language used in the script is subtle and can be easily misinterpreted.
  The translation is intended to provide a clear understanding of the original message,
  while maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of the actors involved.'
