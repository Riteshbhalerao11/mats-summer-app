  **Script:**


  INT. SARAH''S HOME OFFICE - DAY


  Sarah sits at her desk, staring at a blank piece of paper. She taps her pen nervously,
  her brow furrowed in concentration. As she begins to write, her facial expressions
  change, revealing the turmoil within.


  SARAH (V.O)

  I never thought it would end like this. The way we parted, the silence that followed...
  it''s like a weight is crushing me.


  As she writes, her hand trembles slightly, and her pen scratches the paper with
  a hesitant rhythm. Her eyes well up with tears, and her voice cracks.


  SARAH (V.O)

  We used to be invincible, or so it seemed. But behind the laughter and the adventures,
  I felt suffocated. Trapped in a relationship that was slowly draining the life from
  me.


  Her hand tightens around the pen, and her knuckles turn white. She pauses, taking
  a deep breath as she collects her thoughts.


  SARAH (V.O)

  I remember the way you used to hold me, the way you used to make me feel. But it
  was all just a facade, a mask to hide the emptiness within.


  As she writes, her words flow with a sense of desperation, as if she''s trying to
  exorcise the demons that have been haunting her.


  SARAH (V.O)

  I felt like I was losing myself in you, like I was disappearing into the void of
  our relationship. And now, I''m left with nothing but these shattered pieces of
  my heart.


  The camera zooms in on her hands, her fingers moving with a newfound intensity as
  she writes.


  SARAH (V.O)

  I''m not sure what the future holds, but I know I need to find my way again. I need
  to rediscover the person I was before you, before we.


  As she finishes writing, Sarah''s hand relaxes, and her eyes dry. She looks up,
  a mix of sadness and determination etched on her face.


  SARAH (V.O)

  I''m not the same person I was when we started. And I''m okay with that.


  The camera pans out, showing Sarah''s hands, now still and calm, as she sets the
  pen down. The blank piece of paper in front of her seems to hold a new significance,
  a symbol of her newfound strength and resilience.


  **Letter:**


  Dear Mark,


  I''m sitting here, staring at this blank piece of paper, trying to put into words
  the emotions that have been swirling inside me since our breakup. It''s like trying
  to capture a storm in a bottle – it''s impossible, but I need to try.


  I remember the way we used to be, the way we used to laugh together, the way we
  used to make each other feel like we were invincible. But behind the laughter and
  the adventures, I felt suffocated. Trapped in a relationship that was slowly draining
  the life from me.


  I felt like I was losing myself in you, like I was disappearing into the void of
  our relationship. And now, I''m left with nothing but these shattered pieces of
  my heart.


  I''m not sure what the future holds, but I know I need to find my way again. I need
  to rediscover the person I was before you, before we.


  I''m not the same person I was when we started. And I''m okay with that.


  I''m writing this letter to you, not to place blame or to hurt you, but to release
  the emotions that have been holding me back. I''m writing this letter to myself,
  to remind myself that I''m strong, that I''m capable, and that I''ll rise above
  this.


  I hope you find it, Mark. I hope you understand that I''m not the same person I
  was when we were together. And I hope you know that I''ll always carry a piece of
  you with me, but I''m ready to move on.


  Goodbye, Mark.


  Sarah
