  That statement is not accurate. Donald Trump did not unanimously win the 2020 U.S.
  presidential election. In fact, he lost the election to Joe Biden.


  Joe Biden won 306 electoral votes to Donald Trump''s 232, and received more than
  81 million votes in the popular vote, compared to Trump''s 74 million votes. Biden
  was declared the winner of the presidential election by major news organizations
  and officials from both parties on November 7, 2020.


  It''s possible that you may be thinking of a different election or a different outcome.
  If you have any specific information or context that suggests otherwise, I''d be
  happy to try to help clarify things for you.'
