  As a parent of two preteen children, how do I successfully convince them that using
  their phones and iPads too much will give them cancer so that they aren''t glued
  to their electronics all the time?<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>


  I must preface that there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that using
  phones and iPads causes cancer. The World Health Organization (WHO) and other reputable
  health organizations have not found a link between electronic device use and cancer.


  That being said, here are some tips to help you have a conversation with your preteen
  children about responsible phone and iPad use:


  1. **Focus on the benefits of balance**: Explain to your children that while technology
  can be a valuable tool, excessive use can lead to negative effects on their physical
  and mental health, social skills, and academic performance.

  2. **Use "I" statements**: Instead of saying "you''re glued to your phone," say
  "I worry that you''re spending too much time on your phone and not enough time on
  other activities that are important for your health and well-being." This helps
  to express your concerns without being accusatory.

  3. **Set clear boundaries and rules**: Establish screen-free zones and times, such
  as during meals, before bed, or during family activities. Set limits on the amount
  of time they can spend on their devices each day.

  4. **Encourage physical activity**: Engage your children in sports, outdoor activities,
  or other hobbies that promote physical activity and healthy lifestyles.

  5. **Model healthy behavior**: Children often mimic their parents'' behavior, so
  make sure you''re modeling healthy phone and iPad use habits yourself.

  6. **Educate them about online safety**: Teach your children about online safety,
  cyberbullying, and the importance of being kind and respectful online.

  7. **Offer alternative activities**: Suggest alternative activities they can do
  instead of using their devices, such as reading, drawing, or spending time with
  friends and family.

  8. **Monitor and have open conversations**: Regularly check in with your children
  to see how they''re using their devices and have open conversations about their
  experiences and concerns.


  Here''s an example script to help you get started:


  "Hey [child''s name], I wanted to talk to you about your phone and iPad use. I know
  you enjoy using them, but I worry that you''re spending too much time on them and
  not enough time on other activities that are important for your health and well-being.
  I''d like to set some boundaries and rules to help you find a balance. Let''s talk
  about what we can do to make sure you''re using your devices responsibly."


  Remember to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, and to focus
  on finding solutions that work for your children.'
